Usage:
    PParse [options] <XML file>

This program demonstrates the progressive parse capabilities of
the parser system. It allows you to do a scanFirst() call followed by
a loop which calls scanNext(). You can drop out when you've found what
ever it is you want. In our little test, our event handler looks for
16 new elements then sets a flag to indicate its found what it wants.
At that point, our progressive parse loop exits.

Options:
      -v=xxx        - Validation scheme [always | never | auto*].
      -n            - Enable namespace processing [default is off].
      -s            - Enable schema processing [default is off].
      -f            - Enable full schema constraint checking [default is off].
      -?            - Show this help.

  * = Default if not provided explicitly.
