CVE-2016-4463: Apache Xerces-C XML Parser Crashes on Malformed DTD

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Apache Xerces-C XML Parser library versions
prior to V3.1.4

Description: The Xerces-C XML parser fails to successfully parse a
DTD that is deeply nested, and this causes a stack overflow, which
makes a denial of service attack against many applications possible
by an unauthenticated attacker.

Mitigation: Applications that are using library versions older than
V3.1.4 should upgrade as soon as possible. Distributors of older
versions should apply the patches from this subversion revision:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1747619

Note that the nesting limit is currently implemented as a compile-time
constant in order to maintain ABI-compatibility.

In addition, a related enhancement was made to enable applications
to fully disable DTD processing through the use of an environment
variable. Distributors of older versions are urged to incorporate
this patch to enable applications to more fully protect themselves
from future issues if they do not require DTD support. This change
is ABI-compatible and can be found in this subversion revision:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1747620
