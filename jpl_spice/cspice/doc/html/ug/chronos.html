<H2> Summary
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   CHRONOS is a utility program that converts time between various time
   systems. It supports the following time systems:
<P>
 
<DL><DT>
<B>
 UTC
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 Universal Time Coordinated; UTC is a system of time keeping that gives
a name to each instant of time of the International Atomic Time system;
refer to the NAIF Toolkit <a href="../req/time.html">TIME.REQ</a> document for more discussion
regarding UTC;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 ET
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 Ephemeris Time; Ephemeris time is the uniform time scale represented by
the independent variable in the differential equations that describe
the motions of the planets, sun and moon. CHRONOS deals with one of the
two forms of ET -- Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) which is used when
describing the motion of bodies with respect to the solar system
barycenter; refer to the NAIF Toolkit <a href="../req/time.html">TIME.REQ</a> document for more
discussion regarding ET;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 SCLK
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 Spacecraft On-Board Clock Time; SCLK is the onboard time-keeping
mechanism that triggers most spacecraft events and is the fundamental
time measurement for referencing most spacecraft activities and
instrument data; refer to the NAIF Toolkit <a href="../req/sclk.html">SCLK.REQ</a> document for more
discussion regarding SCLK;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 LST
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 Local Solar Time; LST is simply a measure of angles between landing
(sub-spacecraft) and sub-solar meridians on the surface of a body
expressed as a "24 hour" local clock.<BR>
</DL>
   Within the supported time systems CHRONOS recognizes multiple time
   types. The types supported for each system are described below.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="UTC Time Types"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> UTC Time Types
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The following time types are supported for the UTC system:
<P>
 
<DL><DT>
<B>
 SCET
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 Spacecraft Event Time; SCET is the time of an event on-board a
spacecraft; in CHRONOS input/output SCET can be represented by any time
string acceptable in SPICE time conversion routines;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 ERT
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 Earth Received Time; ERT is the time of an event measured on the
ground, such as the time when a signal about an event on-board of a
spacecraft was received on the Earth; in CHRONOS input/output ERT can
be represented by any time string acceptable in SPICE time conversion
routines.<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 ETT
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 Earth Transmit Time; ETT is the time when a signal received on-board a
spacecraft, was transmitted from the Earth; in CHRONOS input/output ETT
can be represented by any time string acceptable in SPICE time
conversion routines.<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 LT
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 One-way Light Time; LT is the one-way light time between the Earth
center of mass and a spacecraft; LT cannot be input to the program; on
output LT is always expressed as a number of seconds; note that LT is
computed using only Newtonian assumptions about the propagation of
light;<BR>
</DL>
   Note that on the input and output SCET, ERT or ETT time in the UTC
   system can be an Earth time zone time if corresponding modifiers are
   present in an input time string or output format picture. A few example
   further in the document demonstrate this.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="ET Time Types"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> ET Time Types
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   All of the above time types are supported ET time types. Also available
   is:
<P>
 
<DL><DT>
<B>
 SECONDS
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 Ephemeris Seconds past epoch J2000 (2000 JAN 01 12:00:00); ET seconds
is the internal SPICE representation for ET.<BR>
</DL>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="SCLK Time Types"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> SCLK Time Types
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The following time types are supported for the SCLK system:
<P>
 
<DL><DT>
<B>
 SCLK
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 String Spacecraft Clock; string SCLK consists of a series of one or
more fields, each containing an integer counter; a partition number
preceding the first (leftmost) field counter and separated from it by a
slash can be present in the string to identify which partition
(interval between resets) this counter's readout belongs to; SCLK
examples:<BR>
</DL>

</PRE>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 TICKS
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 Spacecraft Clock Ticks; SCLK Ticks is the internal SPICE representation
for SCLK; it's a total number of ticks -- smallest increments of
on-board clock -- since the clock was turned on;<BR>
</DL>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="LST Time Types"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> LST Time Types
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The following time types are supported for the LST system:
<P>
 
<DL><DT>
<B>
 LST
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 Local Solar Time; LST is the local solar time expressed by the number
of local solar days (SOLs) from a landing date and using a "24-hour"
clock readout within the current local solar day (HR:MN:SC); LST is a
true local solar time and computed using positions of the Sun and the
landing site from SPICE kernels specified in CHRONOS setup file; if a
landing date is unknown to the program it cannot convert input LST to
any other time system and can compute LST only without SOL number for
the output; LST examples:<BR>
</DL>
<PRE>
                             SOL 12  12:00:01
                             SOL 132 01:22:32.498
                             SOL 2 9
</PRE>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 LSUN
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 Longitude of the Sun; LSUN (also known as "L-sub-s") is the
planetocentric longitude of the sun, as seen from a specified body;
LSUN is often used as a measure of the season on a body: for the
northern hemisphere LSUN changes from 0 (spring) ---- +90 (summer) ----
+/-180 (autumn) ---- -90 (winter) ---- 0 (spring) and so on;
geometrically LSUN is defined in the following frame: the positive Z
direction is given by the instantaneous planetocentric North pole of
the central body; the positive X direction is the cross product of the
positive Z direction with the instantaneous orbital angular velocity
vector; the positive Y direction is the cross product of Z and X.<BR>
</DL>
   Note that CHRONOS doesn't support any approximate local times such as
   computed by approximating over precomputed local midnight or noon epochs
   or computed using mean position of the Sun.

   CHRONOS is a command line program. To convert time from one supported
   system/type to another, CHRONOS is used with the following command line
   options. Those shown within square brackets are optional. A vertical bar
   separates choices, only one of which may be used.
<P>
 
<PRE>
      % CHRONOS  -SETUP &lt;setup file name OR kernel file name(s)&gt;
                 -FROM &lt;"from" time system&gt;

                [-NOLABEL]
                [-TRACE]
</PRE>
   The command line options above have the following meanings:
<P>
 
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -SETUP
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is used to specify a setup file name or directly list the names of
the SPICE kernels to be used by CHRONOS; providing a setup file name on
the command line is optional; if it's not present or is blank, CHRONOS
tries to obtain it from the environment variable CHRONOS_SETUP_FILE;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -FROM
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is used to specify the time system of the input time; specifying
the "from" time system is required;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -FROMTYPE
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is used to specify the time type of the input time; specifying
"from" time type is optional; if it's not present or is blank, CHRONOS
assumes the default time type for the input time system (SCET for UTC
and ET, SCLK for SCLK, and LST for LST);<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -TO
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is used to specify the time system of the output time; specifying
the "to" time system is required;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -TOTYPE
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is used to specify the time type of the output time; specifying
"to" time type is optional; if it's not present or is blank, CHRONOS
assumes the default time type for the output time system (SCET for UTC
and ET, SCLK for SCLK and LST for LST);<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -FORMAT
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is used to specify a custom format for the output time; specifying
a format on the command line is optional; if a format specification is
not present or is blank, CHRONOS looks for a specification in the setup
file and, if such is also not available, it uses the default format;
note that only times in UTC and ET systems can be formatted as a time
time strings on output; refer to Appendix 3 and Appendix 4 for more
information on syntax of the output format specifications for time
strings and DP numbers;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -TIME
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is used to specify the input time on the command line; most time
types of UTC and ET systems require input time to be in a form of a
time string recognized by TIME subsystem of SPICE; refer to Appendix 2
for information on acceptable input time specifications;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -BATCH
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is used to tell the program to take input time(s) from standard
input instead of the command line; if it's present, the program ignores
any input time provided after using the ``-TIME'' command line option;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -SC
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is the NAIF ID for the spacecraft; specifying it on the command
line is optional; if the s/c ID is not present on the command line,
CHRONOS looks for it in the setup file;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -CENTER
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is the NAIF ID for the center body; specifying it on the command
line is optional; if the center body ID is not present on the command
line, CHRONOS looks for it in the setup file;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -LANDINGTIME
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is the UTC time of the landing; specifying it on the command line
is optional; if this time is not present on the command line, CHRONOS
looks for it in the setup file;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -SOL1INDEX
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is the SOL index for the first day on surface; specifying it on
the command line is optional; if this index is not present on the
command line, CHRONOS looks for it in the setup file;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -NOLABEL
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is used to tell the program to not display [SYSTEM]/[TYPE]
following the output time string;<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 -TRACE
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 this is used to tell the program to display trace information
including, complete the command line, names of the loaded SPICE kernel
files, all relevant setup information, etc.; this option overrules the
``-NOLABEL'' option;<BR>
</DL>
   CHRONOS displays help information if the ``-HELP'' or ``-H'' key is
   specified on the command line:
<P>
 
<PRE>
      % CHRONOS -HELP|-H
</PRE>
   If ``-USAGE'', ``-U'' or nothing is provided on the command line,
   CHRONOS displays usage information:
<P>
 
<PRE>
      % CHRONOS [-USAGE|-U]
</PRE>
   If ``-TEMPLATE'' command line option is specified, CHRONOS displays
   setup file template:
<P>
 
<PRE>
      % CHRONOS  -TEMPLATE
</PRE>
   Command line parameters specified in [] are optional. Command line keys
   '-XXXXXXX' are case insensitive. Any of the command line options can be
   present in the command line multiple times (in such cases the last
   appearance of a key takes precedence.) The order in which options are
   specified is insignificant.

   In these examples the command extends over two or three lines with the
   backslash character indicating continuation. The output appears on the
   very next line.
<P>
 
   The examples below assume that a setup file ``setup.mpf'' exists and
   contains correct pointers to the needed MPF SPICE kernel files.
<P>
 
   To compute SCET UTC for a given HEX SCLK CHRONOS must be run with the
   following command line options:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   &gt; chronos -setup setup.mpf -from sclk -fromtype hex \
            -to utc -totype scet -time 4A8ADDCA:48
   1997-08-18 16:57:36.110                          (UTC/SCET)
   &gt;
</PRE>
   To compute LST for a given UTC/ERT CHRONOS must be run as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   &gt; chronos -setup setup.mpf -from lst -to utc -totype ert \
            -time SOL 12 13:00
   1997-07-16 10:39:34.287                          (UTC/ERT)
   &gt;
</PRE>
   In the example above the "-FROMTYPE" option was not needed since the
   time type used was the default.
<P>
 
   The same example using the ``-NOLABEL'' option and formatting the output
   time ``a-la'' UNIX date command output will look like:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   &gt; chronos -setup setup.mpf -from lst -to utc -totype ert \
            -time SOL 12 13:00 -nolabel \
            -format 'Wkd Month DD HR:MN:SC PDT YYYY ::UTC-7'
   Wed July 16 03:39:34 PDT 1997
   &gt;
</PRE>
   Note that in the previous example the ``::UTC-7'' format modifier caused
   time on the output to be Pacific Day Time (PDT) instead of Greenwich
   Meridian Time (GMT) which is default time zone for UTC.
<P>
 
   The opposite conversion with trace ON (``-TRACE'') will produce the
   following output (note that in this example CHRONOS recognized PDT token
   in the input string and processed input time as Pacific Day Time):
<P>
 
<PRE>
   &gt; chronos -setup setup.mpf -from utc -fromtype ert -to lst \

   In the next example CHRONOS is used to convert a few UTC/SCET times
   provided in an external file ``input.times'' (each input time on a line
   by itself with no blank line between them) to the corresponding SCLK
   times written to an output file ``output.times'':
<P>
 
<PRE>
   &gt; chronos -setup setup.mpf -from utc -to sclk \
            -batch -nolabel &lt; input.times &gt; output.times

<H3> Using CHRONOS with Calling Scripts or Aliases
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Specifying all command line options every time you run the program can
   be quite tiring, especially taking into account that most command lines
   require several character strings and selected combinations of
   input/output time systems/types are probably used many times. Therefore,
   it could be very convenient to define a set of aliases or create a
   number of wrapper scripts which will contain preset combinations of
   command line parameters for a given input/output time system/type pair.
   For example, conversion from UTC/SCET to UTC/ERT can be implemented by
   the following alias:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   alias utc2ert 'chronos -from utc  -fromtype scet -to utc  \
                 -totype ert  -format -time'
</PRE>
   or c-shell script ``utc2ert'':
<P>
 
<PRE>
   #!/bin/csh -f
   chronos -from utc  -fromtype scet -to utc \
                 -totype ert  -format -time $argv[*]
</PRE>
   Then to perform the conversion you need to type only

   1998-01-12 13:18:04.672                                 (UTC/ERT)
   &gt;
</PRE>
   Note that since for both the alias and the script a setup file name
   wasn't specified on the command line, CHRONOS used the name provided in
   the environment variable CHRONOS_SETUP_FILE.
<P>
 
   A set of aliases mimicking time tools that were used by the Mars
   Pathfinder project is provided in Appendix 1 at the end of the document.
   It doesn't cover all possible combinations of the input/output time
   system/type pairs but it could be easily extended to do so.
<P>
 
   Using aliases makes using CHRONOS easy, but it seems that by setting
   command line options in these aliases we are taking away some of the
   program's flexibility. This is not true. That CHRONOS allows any command
   line option to be specified as many times as desired (then the last
   appearance/value of it is used) and that blank values are permitted,
   allows one to use any pre-specified alias in the same way as the program
   itself.
<P>
 
   For example, if you want to specify a custom output format while using
   the ``utc2ert'' alias, it can be done with the ``-FORMAT'' command line
   option as it would be while using CHRONOS without any wrappers:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   &gt; utc2ert 1998 JAN 12 11:24 -format YYYY-DOY//HR:MN:SC
</PRE>
   or
<P>
 
<PRE>
   &gt; utc2ert -format YYYY-DOY//HR:MN:SC -time 1998 JAN 12 11:24
</PRE>
   or
<P>
 
<PRE>
   &gt; utc2ert -time 1998 JAN 12 11:24 -format YYYY-DOY//HR:MN:SC
</PRE>
   Note that in the first case the ``-TIME'' command line option wasn't
   needed because it's already present in the ``utc2ert'' alias, while in
   the second example it was required to tell the program that ``1998 JAN
   12 11:24'' is an input time but not a part of the format string
   specified after ``-FORMAT''. In the third case, it seems that we have
   the ``-TIME'' key repeated two times because it's present in the alias
   and on the command line. This is not a problem for CHRONOS, it just
   ignores the first ``-TIME'' and the blank value which appears after it.
<P>
 
   This example can be easily extended to demonstrate other possibilities:

   CHRONOS requires a few parameters to be provided in a setup file. The
   name of a setup file is usually provided on the command line. If it's
   not present there, the program looks for the name associated with the
   environment variable CHRONOS_SETUP_FILE.
<P>
 
   The setup file format must follow the SPICE Kernel Text file format
   rules, i.e. it must contain data formatted as a set of KEYWORD=VALUE
   assignments enclosed between
<P>
 
<PRE>
   \begindata
   \begintext

   markers. Each assignment and marker must be on a line by itself.
<P>
 
   The following parameters may be provided in a setup file:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   \begindata
      LEAPSECONDS_FILE  = 'name of a LSK file'
      SCLK_FILE         = 'name of a SCLK file for the mission'
      PCK_FILE          = 'name of a PCK file'
      SPK_FILES         = ( 'name of an SPK file', '...' )
      CK_FILES          = ( 'name of a CK file', '...' )
      FRAMES_FILE       = 'name of a frame definitions file'
      SPACECRAFT_ID     = NAIF ID for the spacecraft
      CENTER_ID         = NAIF ID for the center body
      LANDING_TIME      = 'UTC time of the landing'
      LANDING_SOL_INDEX = SOL index of the landing
   \begintext
</PRE>
   Note that either or all of the SPACECRAFT_ID, CENTER_ID, LANDING_TIME,
   and LANDING_SOL_INDEX parameters can also be provided using the command
   line switches. If done so, the setup file value corresponding to a
   command line value is not needed, and, if present, is ignored by the
   program.
<P>
 
   Similarly, the kernels files to be loaded can be provided using the
   standard SPICE interface -- with the KERNELS_TO_LOAD parameter:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   \begindata
      KERNELS_TO_LOAD = (
                         'name of a LSK file',
                         'name of a SCLK file ',
                         'name of a PCK file',
                         'name of an SPK file',

                        )
   \begintext

   or using KERNELS_TO_LOAD with additional path specification keywords --
   PATH_VALUES/PATH_SYMBOLS:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   \begindata
      PATH_VALUES      = (
                          '/directory/where/kernels/are'

                          '$KERNELS/name of a SCLK file ',
                          '$KERNELS/name of a PCK file',
                          '$KERNELS/name of an SPK file',

                         )
   \begintext
</PRE>
   or even by simply listing them after the -SETUP command line switch. If
   KERNELS_TO_LOAD, or KERNELS_TO_LOAD + PATH_VALUES/PATH_SYMBOLS, or
   listing kernel names directly on the command line is used, specifying
   the LEAPSECONDS_FILE, SCLK_FILE, PCK_FILE, SPK_FILES, CK_FILES, and
   FRAMES_FILE setup file parameters is not necessary.
<P>
 
   Note that if some data from the LSK or PCK kernels is included directly
   into the setup file, they get loaded into the program automatically. In
   such cases program checks whether required LSK values are already loaded
   and if so it's doesn't load external LSK file(s).
<P>
 
   Custom format for a particular time system/type pair can be specified in
   a setup file using keywords [SYSTEM]_{TYPE}_FORMAT, where [SYSTEM] and
   {TYPE} are corresponding character designations (for example:
   UTC_SCET_FORMAT = 'YYYY-DOY//HR:MN')

   Note that in MPF case more SPICE data is needed to support time
   conversions. It even needs some CK files. The reason is that MPF Lander
   location in the corresponding SPK file is given relative to the surface
   fixed frame rather than relative to the center on Mars in the Mars fixed
   frame as is done for the M98 Lander. Therefore, to compute the location
   of the MPF Lander relative to the Sun or Earth, which is needed for
   converting from/to local time or for computing ERT or ETT, CHRONOS needs
   to load all SPICE kernels containing positions and frame transformation
   information needed to perform such computations.
<P>
 
   The setup file for MPF also contains DOY-style output format pictures
   for UTC/ERT, UTC/SCET, ERT/ERT and ER/SCET system/types.
<P>
 
   As already mentioned CHRONOS automatically loads any KEYWORD=VALUE
   definitions present in the setup file. This can be used to speed program
   execution by placing required LSK and PCK parameters in the setup file
   instead of making the program read them from standard LSK and PCK files
   which will take more time. (Loading data only from one file is is much
   quicker than loading data from two or three text kernels.)

   UTC/(SCET,ERT,ETT) and ET/(SCET,ERT,ETT) times used as input must be
   provided as time strings that can be parsed by the SPICE STR2ET routine.
   Below is an extract from the STR2ET subroutine header, explaining
   acceptable formats and providing some examples.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   The variety of ways people have developed for representing
   times is enormous. It is unlikely that any single subroutine
   can accommodate the wide variety of custom time formats that
   have arisen in various computing contexts. However, we
   believe that this routine will correctly interpret most time
   formats used throughout the planetary science community.
   For example this routine supports ISO time formats, UNIX
   `date` output formats, VMS time formats, MS-DOS formats,
   etc.  One obvious omission from the strings recognized by
   this routine are strings of the form
 
        93234.1829  or 1993234.1829
 
   Some readers may recognize this as the epoch that is 0.1829
   days past the beginning of the 234'th day of 1993.  However,
   other readers may regard this interpretation as a bit
   obscure.
 
   Below we outline some of the rules used in the interpretation
   of strings.  A more complete discussion of the interpretation
   of strings is given in the routine TPARTV.
 
 
   Default Behavior
   ----------------
 
   Consider the string
 
        1988 June 13, 3:29:48
 
   There is nothing in this string to indicate what time system
   the date and time belong to.  Moreover, there is nothing to
   indicate whether the time is based on a 24-hour clock or
   twelve hour clock.
 
   In the absence of such indicators, the default interpretation
   of this string is to regard the time of day to be a time on
   a 24-hour clock in the UTC time system.  The date is a date
   on the Gregorian Calendar (this is the calendar used in nearly
   all western societies).
 
   Labels
   ------
 
   If you add more information to the string, STR2ET can then
   make a more informed interpretation of the time string.
   For example:
 
        1988 June 13, 3:29:48 P.M.
 
   is still regarded as a UTC epoch.  However, with the addition
   of the 'P.M.' label it is now interpreted as the same epoch
   as the unlabeled epoch 1988 June 13, 15:29:48.   Similarly
 
        1988 June 13, 12:29:48 A.M.
 
   is interpreted as
 
         1988 June 13, 00:29:48
 
   For the record: 12:00 A.M. corresponds to Midnight (00:00 on the
   24 hour clock.  12:00 P.M. corresponds to Noon. (12:00) on the
   24 hour clock.
 
   You may add still further indicators to the string.  For example
 
       1988 June 13, 3:29:48 P.M. PST
 
   is interpreted as an epoch in the Pacific Standard Time system.
   This is equivalent to
 
       1988 June 13, 07:29:48 UT
 
   The following U.S. time zones are recognized.
 
      EST   --- Eastern Standard Time  ( UTC-5:00 )
      CST   --- Central Standard Time  ( UTC-6:00 )
      MST   --- Mountain Standard Time ( UTC-7:00 )
      PST   --- Pacific Standard Time  ( UTC-8:00 )
 
      EDT   --- Eastern Daylight Time  ( UTC-4:00 )
      CDT   --- Central Daylight Time  ( UTC-5:00 )
      MDT   --- Mountain Daylight Time ( UTC-6:00 )
      PDT   --- Pacific Daylight Time  ( UTC-7:00 )
 
   Any other time zone may be specified by
   representing its offset from UTC.
 
   This notation starts with the letters 'UTC' followed by a
   '+' for time zones east of Greenwich and '-' for time zones
   west of Greenwich.  This is followed by the number of hours
   to add or subtract from UTC.  This is optionally followed
   by a colon ':' and the number of minutes to add or subtract
   to get the local time zone.  Thus to specify the time zone of
   Calcutta (which is 5 and 1/2 hours ahead of UTC) you would
   specify the time zone to be UTC+5:30.  To specify the time zone
   of Newfoundland (which is 3 and 1/2 hours behind UTC) use the
   offset notation UTC-3:30.
 
   For the Record:  Leapseconds occur at the same time in all
   time zones.  In other words, the seconds component of a time
   string is the same for any time zone as is the seconds
   component of UTC.  Thus the following are all legitimate
   ways to represent an epoch of some event that occurred
   in the leapsecond
 
        1995 December 31 23:59:60.5  (UTC)
 
 
        1996 January   1, 05:29:60.5  (UTC+5:30 --- Calcutta Time)
        1995 December 31, 20:29:60.5  (UTC-3:30 --- Newfoundland)
        1995 December 31  18:59:60.5  (EST)
        1995 December 31  17:59:60.5  (CST)
        1995 December 31  16:59:60.5  (MST)
        1995 December 31  15:59:60.5  (PST)
 
 
   In addition to specifying time zones, you may specify
   that the string be interpreted as a formal calendar
   representation in either the Barycentric Dynamical Time system
   (TDB) or the Terrestrial Dynamical Time system (TDT).  In
   These systems there are no leapseconds.  Times in TDB
   are written as
 
     1988 June 13, 12:29:48 TDB
 
   TDT times are written as:
 
     1988 June 13, 12:29:48 TDT
 
   Finally, you may explicitly state that the time system is UT
 
     1988 June 13, 12:29:48 UTC.
 
 
   Note that you may not specify two different time systems
   simultaneously.  For example
 
     1988 June 13, 12:29:48 PDT TDT
 
   You might be able to make some kind of reasonable guess as
   to the meaning of this string, but we've decided to regard
   such strings as errors.
 
   Abbreviating Years
   ------------------
 
   Although it can lead to confusion, many people are in the
   habit of abbreviating years when they write them in dates.
   For example
 
      99 Jan 13,  12:28:24
 
   Upon seeing such a string, most of us would regard this
   as being 1999 January 13, 12:28:24 and not January 13 of
   the year 99.  This routine interprets years that are less
   than 100 as belonging either to the 1900's or 2000's.  Years
   greater than 68 ( 69 - 99 ) are regarded as being an
   abbreviation with the '19' suppressed (1969 - 1999).  Years
   smaller than 69 ( 00 - 68 ) are regarded as being an
   abbreviation with the '20' suppressed (2000 - 2068).
 
   Note that in general it is usually a good idea to write
   out the year.  Or if you'd like to save some typing
   abbreviate 1999 as '99.
 
   If you need to specify an epoch whose year
   is less than 1000, we recommend that you specify the era
   along with the year.  For example if you want to specify
   the year 13 A.D. write it as
 
     13 A.D. Jan 12
 
   When specifying the era it should immediately follow the year.
   Both the A.D. and B.C. eras are supported.
 
 
   Changing Default Behavior
   -------------------------
 
   As discussed above, if a string is unlabelled, it is regarded
   as representing a string in the UTC time system on the
   Gregorian calendar.  Abbreviated years are
   regarded as abbreviations of the years from 1969 to 2068.
 
   You may modify these defaults through the routines TIMDEF
   and TSETYR (an entry point of TEXPYR).
 
   You may:
 
     Set the calendar to be Gregorian, Julian or a mixture of
     the two using TIMDEF;
 
     Set the time system to be UTC, TDB, TDT or any time zone
     using TIMDEF;
 
     Set the range of year abbreviations to be any 100 year
     interval using TSETYR.
 
   See the routines TEXPYR and TIMDEF for details on changing
   defaults.
 
   These alterations affect only the interpretation of unlabelled
   strings.  If an input string is labelled the specification
   in the label is used.
 
 
   If some component of a date or time is "out-of-range" STR2ET
   regards the string as erroneous.  Below is a list of
   erroneous strings and why they are regarded as such.
 
     1997 Jan 32 12:29:29     --- there are only 31 days in January
 
     '98 Jan 12 13:29:29 A.M. --- Hours must be between 1 and 12
                                  inclusive when A.M. or P.M. is
                                  specified.
 
     1997 Feb 29, 12:29:20.0  --- February has only 28 days in
                                  1997. This would be ok if the
                                  year was 1996.
 
 
     1992 Mar 12 12:62:20     --- Minutes must be between 0 and 59
                                  inclusive.
 
     1993 Mar 18 15:29:60.5   --- Seconds is out of range for this
                                  date.  It would not be out of
                                  range for Dec 31 23:59:60.5 or
                                  Jun 30 23:59:60.5 because these
                                  can be leapseconds (UTC).
 
   Specifics On Interpretation of the Input String
   -----------------------------------------------
 
   The process of examining the string to determine its meaning
   is called "parsing" the string. The string is parsed by first
   determining its recognizable substrings (integers, punctuation
   marks, names of months, names of weekdays, time systems, time
   zones, etc.)  These recognizable substrings are called the
   tokens of the input string.  The meaning of some tokens are
   immediately determined.  For example named months, weekdays and
   time systems have clear meanings.  However, the meaning of
   a numeric component must be deciphered from its magnitude
   and location in the string relative to the immediately recognized
   components of the input string.
 
   To determine the meaning of the numeric tokens in the input
   string, a set of "production rules" and transformations are
   applied to the full set of tokens in the string.  These
   transformations are repeated until the meaning of every token
   has been determined or until further transformations yield
   no new clues into the meaning of the numeric tokens.
 
   1)  Unless the substring 'JD' or 'jd' is present, the string is
       assumed to be a calendar format (day-month-year or year and
       day of year).  If the substring JD or jd is present, the
       string is assumed to represent a Julian date.
 
   2)  If the Julian date specifier is not present, any integer
       greater than 999 is regarded as being a year specification.
 
   3)  A dash '-' can represent a minus sign only if it precedes
       the first digit in the string and the string contains
       the Julian date specifier (JD).  (No negative years,
       months, days, etc are allowed).
 
   4)  Numeric components of a time string must be separated
       by a character that is not a digit or decimal point.
       Only one decimal component is allowed.  For example
       1994219.12819 is sometimes interpreted as the
       219th day of 1994 + 0.12819 days.  STR2ET does not
       support such strings.
 
       No exponential components are allowed.  For example you
       can't input 1993 Jun 23 23:00:01.202E-4 you have
       to explicitly list all zeros that follow the decimal
       point: i.e.  1993 Jun 23 23:00:00.0001202
 
   5)  The single colon (:) when used to separate numeric
       components of a string is interpreted as separating
       Hours, Minutes, and Seconds of time.
 
   6)  If a double slash (//) or double colon (::) follows
       a pair of integers, those integers are assumed  to
       represent the year and day of year.
 
   7)  A quote followed by an integer less than 100 is regarded
       as an abbreviated year.  For example: '93 would be regarded
       as the 93rd year of the reference century.  See TEXPYR
       for further discussion of abbreviated years.
 
    8) An integer followed by 'B.C.' or 'A.D.' is regarded as
       a year in the era associated with that abbreviation.
 
    9) All dates are regarded as belonging to the extended
       Gregorian Calendar (the Gregorian calendar is the calendar
       currently used by western society).  See the routine TIMDEF
       to modify this behavior.
 
   10) If the International Standard Organization (ISO)
       date-time separator (T) is present in the string
       ISO allowed token patterns are examined for a match
       with the current token list.  If no match is found the
       search is abandoned and appropriate diagnostic messages
       are generated.
 
   11) If two delimiters are found in succession in the time
       string, the time string is diagnosed as an erroneous
       string.  ( Delimiters are comma, white space, dash, forward
       slash, period, day of year mark "//" or "::" )
 
       Note the delimiters do not have to be the same. The pair
       of characters ",-" counts as two successive delimiters.
 
   12) White space and commas serve only to delimit tokens in the
       input string.  They do not affect the meaning of any
       of the tokens.
 
   13) If an integer is greater than 1000 (and the 'JD' label
       is not present, the integer is regarded as a year.
 
   14) When the size of the integer components does not clearly
       specify a year the following patterns are assumed
 
       Calendar Format
 
           Year Month Day
           Month Day Year
           Year Day Month
 
           Where Month is the name of a month, not its numeric
           value.
 
           When integer components are separated by slashes (/)
           as in 3/4/5.  Month, Day, Year is assumed (2005 March 4)
 
        Day of Year Format.
 
           If a day of year marker is present (// or ::) the
           pattern
 
           I-I// or I-I:: (where I stands for an integer)
           is interpreted as Year Day-of-Year. However, I-I/ is
           regarded as ambiguous.

   * The default interpretation of a year that has been
   abbreviated to two digits with or without a leading quote
   as in 'xy or xy (such as '92 or 92) is to treat the year as
   19xy if xy &gt; 68 and to treat it as 20xy otherwise. Thus '70
   is interpreted as 1970 and '67 is treated as 2067. However,
   you may change the "split point" and centuries through use
   of the SPICE routine TSETYR. See that routine for a
   discussion of how you may reset the split point.
 
   ** All epochs are regarded as belonging to the Gregorian
   calendar. We formally extend the Gregorian calendar backward
   and forward in time for all epochs. If you have epochs
   belonging to the Julian Calendar, consult the SPICELIB
   routines TPARTV and JUL2GR for a discussion concerning
   conversions to the Gregorian calendar and ET. The routines
   TIMDEF and STR2ET, used together, also support conversions
   from Julian Calendar epochs to ET.
 
   +  When a day of year format or calendar format string is
   input and neither of the integer components of the date
   is greater than 1000, the first integer
   is regarded as being the year.
 
   Any integer greater than 1000 is regarded as a year
   specification. Thus 1001-1821//12:28:28 is interpreted as
   specifying two years and will be rejected as ambiguous.

<H2> Appendix 3: Output Time String Formatting Rules
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   UTC/(SCET,ERT,ETT) and ET/(SCET,ERT,ETT) times output from CHRONOS are
   formatted as time string in accordance with the format picture
   specification recognized by SPICE's TIMOUT routine. Below is an extract
   from the TIMOUT subroutine header, explaining acceptable specifications
   of output format pictures and providing some examples.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   A format picture is simply a string of letters that lets
   TIMOUT know where various components of a time representation
   should be placed during creation of the time string.
   Here's an example of such a picture:
 
      MON DD,YYYY  HR:MN:SC.#### (TDB) ::TDB
 
   Here is a sample of times that would be created by
   using this format.
 
      JAN 12,1992  12:28:18.2772 (TDB)
      FEB 13,1994  23:18:25.2882 (TDB)
      AUG 21,1995  00:02:00.1881 (TDB)
 
   As you can see from the samples above, the format picture
   specifies that every time string created should begin
   with a three-letter abbreviation for the month, followed
   by a space and the day of the month. The day of month is
   followed immediately by a comma and the year. The year
   component is followed by two spaces. The next outputs are
   hours represented as a two digit integer, a colon, minutes as
   represented a two digit integer, another colon, and seconds
   rounded to 4 decimal places and having a two digit integer
   part. This is followed by a space and the string (TDB). The
   special marker `::TDB' in the time picture is an
   ``invisible'' marker. It is used to specify the time
   system that should be used in creating the time string
   (in this case Barycentric Dynamical Time).
 
   TIMOUT does not recognize all of the parts of the time
   format picture in the example above. The list of recognized
   parts and unrecognized parts is shown in the table below.
 
     Recognized       Unrecognized
     ----------       ------------
     'MON'            ' '
     'DD'             ','
     'YYYY'           '  '
     'HR'             ':'
     'MN'             '(TDB)'
     'SC'
     '.####'
     '::TDB'
 
   The unrecognized parts are called literal markers.  They are
   copied exactly as they appear in PICTUR into the output string.
   The recognized parts of the picture are replaced by a
   component of time or, as in the case of `::TDB', are used
   as instructions about the overall properties of the time
   string.
 
   The full list of recognized markers, their classification
   and meaning are given below.

                          day of week.
 
   String Markers
 
      String markers are portions of the format picture that
      will be replaced with a character string that represents
      the corresponding component of a time.
 
   Numeric Markers
 
      Numeric markers are portions of the format picture that
      will be replaced with a decimal string that represents
      the corresponding component of a time.
 
   Meta Markers
 
      Meta markers (listed under the class ``meta'' in the
      table above) are used to indicate `global' properties of
      your time string. You may specify time scale and how
      rounding should be performed on the components of time
      in your output string. Meta markers may be placed anywhere
      in your format picture. They do not contribute to placement
      of characters in output time strings. Also there are no
      restrictions on how many meta markers you may place in
      the format picture. However, if you supply conflicting
      `meta' markers (for example ::TDT and ::TDB) in your
      picture the first marker listed (in left to right order)
      overrules the conflicting marker that appears later in
      the picture.
 
   Default Meta Markers
 
      If you do not specify a time system, calendar, or time
      zone through the use of a Meta Marker, TIMOUT uses the
      values returned by the SPICE routine TIMDEF. The default
      time system, calendar returned by TIMDEF are UTC and
      the Gregorian calendar.  The default time zone returned
      by TIMDEF is a blank indicating that no time zone offset
      should be used.
 
      See the header for the routine TIMDEF for a more complete
      discussion of setting and retrieving default values.
 
   Modifier Markers
 
      The numeric markers listed in the table above stand
      for integers unless they are modified through use of a
      modifier marker. The strings
 
         .#
         .##
         .###
         .####
 
      are used to this end. When a numeric marker is followed
      immediately by one of these modifiers, the corresponding
      time component will be written with the number of decimal
      places indicated by the number of successive occurrences of
      the character '#'. Any numeric token may be modified.
 
   Rounding vs. Truncation
 
      The meta markers ::TRNC and ::RND allow you to control
      how the output time picture is rounded. If you specify
      ::TRNC all components of time are simply truncated to
      the precision specified by the marker and any modifier.
      If you specify ::RND the output time is rounded to the
      least significant component of the format picture. The
      default action is truncation.
 
      Whether an output time string should be rounded or
      truncated depends upon what you plan to do with the
      string. For example suppose you simply want to get the
      calendar date associated with a time and not the time of
      day. Then you probably do not want to round your output.
      Rounding 1992 Dec 31, 13:12:00 to the nearest day
      produces 1993 Jan 1. Thus in this case rounding is probably
      not appropriate.
 
      However, if you are producing output for plotting using
      Julian Date, seconds past 1950 or seconds past
      2000, you will probably want your output rounded so as
      to produce a smoother plot.
 
   Time Systems
 
      TIMOUT can produce output strings for epochs relative to
      any of the three systems UTC, TDT, or TDB.  If you do not
      explicitly specify a time system, TIMOUT will produce strings
      relative to the time system returned by the SPICE routine
      TIMDEF.  Unless you call TIMDEF and change it, the default time
      system is UTC.  However, by using one of the Meta Markers
      ::UTC, ::TDT, or ::TDB you may specify that TIMOUT produce
      time strings relative to the UTC, TDT, or TDB system
      respectively.
 
   Time Zones
 
      The meta markers ::UTC+h:m  and ::UTC-h:m  allow you
      offset UTC times so that you may represent times in
      a time zone other than GMT.  For example you can
      output times in Pacific Standard time by placing the
      meta-marker ::UTC-8 in your format picture.
 
      For instance, if you use the picture
 
         YYYY Mon DD, HR:MN:SC ::UT
 
      you will get output strings such as:
 
         1995 Jan 03, 12:00:00
 
      If you use the picture
 
         YYYY Mon DD, HR:MN:SC ::UTC-8
 
      you will get output strings such as:
 
         1995 Jan 03, 04:00:00
 
      Finally, if you use the picture
 
         YYYY Mon DD, HR:MN:SC ::UTC-8:15
 
      you will get output strings such as
 
         1995 Jan 03, 03:45:00
 
      Note that the minutes are always added or subtracted
      based on the sign present in the time zone specifier.
      In the case of ::UTC+h:m, minutes are added. In the
      case ::UTC-h:m, minutes are subtracted.
 
      The unsigned part of the hours component can be no more
      than 12.  The unsigned part of the minutes component can
      be no more than 59.
 
   Calendars
 
      The calendar currently used by western countries is the
      Gregorian calendar.  This calendar begins on Oct 15, 1582.
      Prior to Gregorian calendar the Julian calendar was used.
      The last Julian calendar date prior to the beginning
      of the Gregorian calendar is Oct 5, 1582.
 
      The primary difference between the Julian and Gregorian
      calendars is in the determination of leap years.
      Nevertheless both can be formally extended backward and
      forward in time indefinitely.
 
      By default TIMOUT uses the default calendar returned by TIMDEF.
      Under most circumstances this will be the Gregorian calendar
      (::GCAL).  However you may specify that TIMOUT use a specific
      calendar through use of one of the calendar Meta Markers. You
      may specify that TIMOUT use the Julian calendar (::JCAL), the
      Gregorian calendar (::GCAL)  or a mixture of both (::MCAL).
 
      If you specify ::MCAL, epochs that occur after the
      beginning of the Gregorian calendar will be represented
      using the Gregorian calendar and epochs prior to the
      beginning of the Gregorian calendar will be represented
      using the Julian calendar.
 
   Getting Software to Construct Pictures for You.
 
      Although it is not difficult to construct time format
      pictures, you do need to be aware of the various markers
      that may appear in a format picture.
 
      There is an alternative means for getting a format picture.
      The routine TPICTR constructs format pictures from a sample
      time string. For example, suppose you would like your
      time strings to look like the basic pattern of the string
      below.
 
         'Fri Jul 26 12:22:09 PDT 1996'
 
      You can call TPICTR with this string, and it will create
      the appropriate PICTUR for use with TIMOUT.
 
         CALL TPICTR ( 'Fri Jul 26 12:22:09 PDT 1996', PICTUR, OK )
 
      The result will be:
 
         'Wkd Mon DD HR:MN:SC (PDT) ::UTC-7'
 
      Note: not every date that you can read is interpretable
      by TPICTR.  For example, you might be able to understand
      that 19960212121116 is Feb 2 1996, 12:11:16.  However,
      TPICTR cannot recognize this string.  Thus it is important
      to check the logical output OK to make sure that TPICTR was
      able to understand the time picture you provided.
 
      Even thought TPICTR can not recognize every time pattern
      that has been used by various people, it does recognize
      nearly all patterns that you use when you want to communicate
      outside your particular circle of colleagues.

   On output UTC/LT, ET/(LT,SECONDS) and LST/LSUN are formatted as DP
   numbers in accordance with a format picture specification recognized by
   SPICE's DPFMT routine. Below is an extract from the DPFMT subroutine
   header explaining acceptable specifications of an output DP format
   picture and providing some examples.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   Format Picture Construction Rules
   ---------------------------------
 
   A format picture is a string used to describe the format of
   the output string.  There are four special characters
   recognized by DPFMT --- a leading + or -, a leading
   zero ( '0' ) or a zero that follows a leading + or -,
   and the first decimal point of the string.
 
   All other non-blank characters are regarded as
   equivalent.  The picture ends at the first blank
   character.  The effects associated with the various
   characters in a picture are spelled out in the
   description of the output STRING.
 
   The following pictures are treated as errors.
 
   ' ', '+', '-', '.', '+.', '-.'
 
   If the first character of the picture is a minus sign,
   the first character in the output string will be
   a blank if the number is non-negative, a minus sign
   if the number is negative.
 
   If the first character of the picture is a plus sign,
   the first character of the output string will be a
   plus if the number is positive, a blank if the number
   is zero, and a minus sign if the number is negative.
 
   If the first character of the string is NOT a sign
   (plus or minus) the first character of the output
   string will be a minus sign if the number is negative
   and will be the first character of the integer part
   of the number otherwise.
 
   The integer portion of STRING will contain the same
   number of characters as appear before the decimal point
   (or last character if there is no decimal point) but
   after a leading + or -.
 
   If the picture begins with any of the following
 
      '+0', '-0', or '0'
 
   it is said to have a leading zero.  If a picture has
   a leading zero and the integer portion is not large
   enough to fill up the integer space specified by
   PICTUR, STRING will be zero padded from the sign (if
   one is required) up to the first character of the
   integer part of the number.
 
   If picture does NOT have a leading zero and
   the integer portion is not large enough to fill up
   the space specified by PICTUR, STRING will be blank
   padded on the left between the sign (if one is required)
   and the first character of the integer part of the
   number.
 
   If a decimal point ( '.' ) is present in PICTUR it
   will be present following the integer portion of
   STRING. Moreover, the decimal portion of STRING will
   contain the same number of digits as there are
   non-blank characters following the decimal point in
   PICTUR.  However, only the first 14 digits starting
   with the first non-zero digit are meaningful.
 
   If the format specified by PICTUR does not provide
   enough room for the integer portion of X, the routine
   determines whether or not the number of characters
   present in the picture is sufficient to create a
   representation for X using scientific notation.  If
   so, the output is displayed using scientific notation
   (leading signs if they are present in PICTUR, will
   also appear in STRING).   If the format specified
   by PICTUR is too short to accommodate scientific
   notation, the output string is filled with '*' to
   the same length as the length of PICTUR. Leading
   signs are not preserved in this overflow case.
 
   Examples
   --------
 
   Suppose that X has the binary representation of PI.
   Then the table below illustrates the strings that
   would be produced by a variety of different pictures.
 
   PICTUR         |    STRING
   -------------------------------
   '0x.xxx'       |  '03.142'
   'xx.xxx'       |  ' 3.142'
   '+xxx.yyyy'    |  '+  3.1416'
   '-.yyyy'       |  '******'
   'xxxxxxxx'     |  '       3'
   '00xx'         |  '0003'
   '-00.0000000'  |  ' 03.1415927'
   '00'           |  '03'
   'x.'           |  '3.'
   '.mynumber'    |  '3.142E+00'
   'my dog spot'  |  ' 3'
   'my.dog spot'  |  ' 3.142'
   '+my.dog,spot' |  '+ 3.14159265'
 
 
 
   Suppose that X has the binary representation of 2/3.
   Then the table below illustrates the strings that
   would be produced by a variety of different pictures.
 
   PICTUR         |    STRING
   -------------------------------
   '+x.xxx'       |  '+0.667'
   '+xx.xxx'      |  '+ 0.667'
   'xxx.yyyy'     |  '  0.6667'
   '.yyyy'        |  '.6667'
   'xxxxxxxx'     |  '       1'
   '00xx'         |  '0001'
   '-0.0000000'   |  ' 0.6666667'
   '00'           |  '01'
   'x.'           |  '1.'
   'mynumber'     |  '       1'
   'my dog spot'  |  ' 1'
   'my.dog spot'  |  ' 0.667'
   'my.dog,spot'  |  ' 0.66666667'
 
   Suppose that X has the binary representation of
   -8/9. Then the table below illustrates the strings
   that would be produced by a variety of different
   pictures.
 
 
   PICTUR         |    STRING
   -------------------------------
   '+x.xxx'       |  '-0.889'
   '-00.xxxx'     |  '-00.8889'
   'xxx.xxx'      |  ' -0.889'
   '000.000'      |  '-00.889'
