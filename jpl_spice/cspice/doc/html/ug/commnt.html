   To use COMMNT as a command line utility, supply additional arguments as
   shown below:
<P>
 
   See the command line mode usage:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   prompt&gt; commnt -h
</PRE>
   Add comments to a kernel file from a text file.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   prompt&gt; commnt -a kernel_file comment_file
</PRE>
   Extract comments from a kernel file to a text file.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   prompt&gt; commnt -e kernel_file comment_file
</PRE>
   Read the comments in a kernel file, displaying the results on the
   Standard Output device.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   prompt&gt; commnt -r kernel_file
</PRE>
   Delete all of the comments in a kernel file.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   prompt&gt; commnt -d kernel_file
</PRE>
   Note that in either mode the program cannot perform operations that
   require modifying the file -- addition and deletion -- if the file does
   not have the format native to the computer, on which the program is run.
   Refer to the CONVERT User's Guide (<a href="../ug/convert.html">convert.ug</a>) for details.

<H2> Overview
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The COMMNT utility program provides a collection of services useful for
   manipulating and examining the contents of the comment area in SPICE
   binary kernel files. The COMMNT program can add comments to the comment
   area from a text file, read the comment area, displaying the comments on
   the terminal screen, extract the comment area to a text file, or delete
   the entire comment area of a SPICE binary kernel file.
<P>
 
   The comment area of a SPICE binary kernel file provides a mechanism for
   storing printable textual information that is related to the data
   contained in the file. The comment area is typically used to ``attach''
   metadata (i.e. a description of the data) to the data contained in the
   file. When used in this manner, the comment area provides a convenient
   mechanism for maintaining the association between a description of the
   data in a file and the data itself. A common use of the comment area
   would be to store the following types of descriptive information: how
   the data in the file were generated, assumptions made about the data,
   who to contact about problems or questions, the creator of the file,
   intended uses of the data, etc.. This type of descriptive information is
   essential for the correct interpretation and use of the data.
<P>
 
   Through a conscientious use of the comment area, all of the information
   necessary to understand the data is readily available with the data.
   Contrast this with an approach where the descriptive information is
   stored in a file separate from the data. In this case, the description
   could easily be lost or forgotten, and without the descriptive
   information, determining the utility or applicability of the data in a
   file would be difficult.
<P>
 
   The COMMNT program supports the CK, DSK, EK, PCK, and SPK SPICE binary
   kernel file formats. CK files contain orientation information, commonly
   called ``pointing,'' for various spacecraft structures or instruments.
   DSK files contain shape models for extended objects. EK files contain
   time tagged event information for a spacecraft. Binary PCK files contain
   body orientation models. Binary PCK files are currently only available
   for the Earth and the Moon with limited time coverage. SPK files contain
   ephemeris information for solar system objects: planets, satellites,
   comets, asteroids, and spacecraft.
<P>
 
   The comments are stored in a ``what you put in is what you get out''
   fashion, so care should be taken when formatting the comments before
   placing them into the comment area of a SPICE binary kernel file.

   COMMNT can now be used as a command line driven program. This makes the
   program more useful for script programs that need to manipulate the
   comment area of SPICE binary kernels.

   Filenames are required for options in the COMMNT program. In order to
   maintain portability a filename must, in addition to any conditions
   imposed by a particular computer or operating system, satisfy the
   following conditions.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> A filename must be nonblank.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> A filename may not contain embedded spaces.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> A filename may not contain nonprinting or ``control'' characters, e.g.,
tabs, line feeds, carriage returns, nulls, form feeds, etc.. The
nonprinting and control characters are those with decimal values 0-31 and
127.
<BR><BR></UL>
   Be aware that on many computer systems filenames are case sensitive. On
   such a system, the filenames `program.for' and `PROGRAM.FOR' are
   different. On a computer system that does not support case sensitive
   filenames these filenames would both refer to the same file.
<P>
 
   Also be aware that each computer system will have a limit on the length
   of a filename. Care must be taken when moving files from a computer
   system which supports longer filenames to a computer system which
   supports shorter filenames, in particular if the initial portion of the
   filenames are identical.
<P>
 
   When extracting comments into a text file the COMMNT program will not
   allow an existing filename to be used. Before the program creates a file
   it determines whether a file with the entered filename already exists.
   If so, a brief message reporting this is displayed and an opportunity to
   reenter the filename will be provided. This is done in order to prevent
   accidental modification of existing files.
<P>
 
   If at any time an improper filename is entered: a file which did not
   exist when it should have, a file which existed when it should not have,
   or a filename containing improper characters, an appropriate error
   message will be displayed. A chance to reenter the filename will be
   provided via a ``Try again? (Yes/No)'' prompt. A response of ``Yes'' and
   the prompt for the filename will be redisplayed. A response of ``No''
   will return the program to the main menu.

   If you execute the program without providing any command line arguments,
   you will be presented with a menu of optional actions. An option is
   selected by entering the letter or number appearing in parentheses to
   the left of the option's description. The selection of an option is not
   case sensitive.
<P>
 
   If an error occurs during the execution of a COMMNT option while the
   program is in interactive mode, the program will display an appropriate
   error message, recover and return to the main menu. See the descriptions
   of the COMMNT options to determine what effect an error may have on the
   outcome of the selected service.

<H3> COMMNT Option: A -- Add comments to a binary file.
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Add comments from a text file to the comment area of a SPICE binary
   kernel file.
<P>
 
   This option requires that two filenames be supplied:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The name of an existing text file which contains comments that are to be
placed into the comment area of a specified SPICE binary kernel file.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The name of an existing SPICE binary kernel file.
<BR><BR></UL>
   When this option is selected, prompts requesting each of the required
   filenames will be displayed. For each prompt, the appropriate filename
   should be entered.
<P>
 
   Upon successful completion of this option, the comments from the text
   file will have been added to the comment area of the binary kernel file.
   If the comment area of the binary kernel file already contains comments,
   a single blank comment line is inserted after the existing comments, and
   then the new comments are appended. Otherwise, the comments are simply
   added to the comment area.
<P>
 
   As mentioned, the comments from the text file are placed into the
   comment area of the SPICE binary kernel file in a ``what you put in is
   what you get out'' fashion, so care should be taken when formatting the
   comments before they are added to a SPICE binary kernel file. In
   particular, the length of individual comment lines should be
   ``reasonable.'' A length not exceeding 80 characters is recommended, as
   it works well with most display devices, terminal screens, printers,
   etc.. An individual comment line in the text file may contain at most
   255 characters. Any characters beyond this number are ignored.
<P>
 
   The comments may contain only printing ASCII characters (decimal values
   32 -- 126). Nonprinting characters such as tab and form--feed are not
   allowed and will result in an error if encountered in the comments.
   Leading and embedded blanks in the comment lines are preserved, but
   trailing blanks are removed. This preserves the overall appearance of
   the comments while conserving space in the comment area of the file.
<P>
 
   WARNING: If an error occurs during the execution of this option, the
   SPICE binary kernel file may be corrupted due to a partial addition of
   the comments. The text file containing the comments will not be
   affected. It is advisable to keep a backup copy of the binary kernel
   file.
<P>

   created for the extracted comments must be that of a new file.
   Otherwise, COMMNT will report that the file already exists and provide
   an opportunity to reenter the filename.
<P>
 
   Upon successful completion of this option the comments from the SPICE
   binary kernel file will be in the specified text file.
<P>
 
   If an error occurs during the execution of this option, the SPICE binary
   kernel file will be unaffected. The text file that was being created
   will be deleted since the complete contents of the comment area may not
   have been extracted.

</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Delete the comments in the comment area of a SPICE binary kernel file.
<P>
 
   This option requires the name of the binary file which is to have its
   comment area deleted.
<P>
 
   A prompt requesting the required filename will be displayed, and the
   appropriate filename should be entered at this time.
<P>
 
   Upon successful completion of this option, the comments will have been
   deleted from the SPICE binary kernel file that was specified. Deleting
   the comments does NOT reduce the size of the existing binary file. The
   space used by the comment area is reclaimed for later use.
<P>
 
   WARNING: If an error occurs during the execution of this option, the
   SPICE binary kernel file may be corrupted due to a partial deletion of
   the comments. It is advisable to keep a backup copy of the binary kernel
   file.
