<H2> Abstract
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   FRMDIFF is a program that samples orientation of a reference frame known
   to SPICE or computes differences between orientations of two reference
   frames known to SPICE, and either displays this orientation or these
   differences, or shows statistics about it or them.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Summary"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Summary
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   FRMDIFF provides means for sampling orientation of a single reference
   frame, or for comparing orientations of two reference frames known to
   SPICE and supported by data from SPICE kernels.
<P>
 
   To sample orientation of a single frame the program computes a set of
   transformations from one frame (the ``from'' frame) to another frame
   (the ``to'' frame) over an interval of time with fixed or variable time
   step, using a given set of kernel files. Then, depending on the
   requested type of output report, it prints to the screen a table
   containing these transformations expressed as total rotation angles and
   axes, quaternions, matrices or Euler angles and angular velocities, or
   only magnitude of the maximum rotation and angular velocity, or results
   of a simple statistical analysis of rotations.
<P>
 
   To compare orientations of two frames the program computes a set of
   transformations from one frame (the ``from'' frame) to another frame
   (the ``to'' frame) over an interval of time with a fixed or variable
   time step using one set of kernels, computes a set of transformations
   for the same or a different ``from''-``to'' frame combination at the
   same times using the same or a different set of kernels, and then
   computes the difference in rotation and angular velocity between the
   corresponding transformations. Depending on the requested type of output
   report the program prints to the screen only maximum differences in
   rotation and angular velocity, or a complete table of rotation and
   angular velocity differences expressed as total rotation angles and
   axes, matrices, quaternions, or Euler angles, or results of a simple
   statistical analysis of the rotation differences.

   This section shows four very common FRMDIFF usage scenarios with just
   enough explanations to get you going. An extensive set of detailed
   examples is provided at the end of this User's Guide.

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> To Check if Two CK Files Provide Identical Data
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   To check if two CK files containing orientation for the same structure
   with respect to the same reference frame provide identical data, run
   FRMDIFF as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   % frmdiff -k &lt;lsk&gt; &lt;sclk&gt; &lt;fk&gt; -s &lt;step&gt; &lt;ck1&gt; &lt;ck2&gt;
</PRE>
   where ``&lt;lsk&gt;'', ``&lt;sclk&gt;'', ``&lt;fk&gt;'', ``&lt;ck1&gt;''
   and ``&lt;ck2&gt;'' are the names of LSK, SCLK, FK, and two CK files
   (all five are required), and ``step'' is the time step, in seconds. If
   the maximum rotation angle in the output is zero (or close to zero,
   accounting for round off), then the CKs contain the same data. To
   include angular velocities in comparison, add ``-a yes'' before ``-s'',
   like this:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   % frmdiff -k &lt;lsk&gt; &lt;sclk&gt; &lt;fk&gt; -a yes -s &lt;step&gt; &lt;ck1&gt; &lt;ck2&gt;

<A NAME="To Assess Difference Between Two CK Files"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> To Assess Difference Between Two CK Files
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   To assess the difference between two CK files containing orientation for
   the same structure with respect to the same reference frame as a
   function of time, run FRMDIFF as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   % frmdiff -k &lt;lsk&gt; &lt;sclk&gt; &lt;fk&gt; -t dumpaa -s &lt;step&gt; &lt;ck1&gt; &lt;ck2&gt;
</PRE>
   where ``&lt;lsk&gt;'', ``&lt;sclk&gt;'', ``&lt;fk&gt;'', ``&lt;ck1&gt;''
   and ``&lt;ck2&gt;'' are the names of LSK, SCLK, FK, and two CK files
   (all five are required); ``-t dumpaa'' sets the output format to the
   rotation angle and axis dump; and ``step'' is the time step, in seconds.
   The program's output, which can be rather lengthy, can be re-directed to
   a file using the ``&gt;'' pipe. Using the data captured in the file the
   total rotation angle (column 2) can be plotted against TDB seconds
   (column 1) to analyze the difference. To print output time tags as UTC
   in ISO date format instead of TDB seconds, add
<P>
 
<PRE>
   -f 'YYYY-MM-DDTHR:MN:SC.### ::RND'
</PRE>
   before ``-k''. To use the Euler angle dump output instead of the
   rotation angle and axis dump output, replace ``dumpaa'' with ``dumpea''.
   To include angular velocities in the comparison, add ``-a yes'' before
   ``-s'', like this (the command line below is wrapped to fit the page
   width):
<P>
 
<PRE>
   % frmdiff -k &lt;lsk&gt; &lt;sclk&gt; &lt;fk&gt; -t dumpaa -a yes -s &lt;step&gt;
             &lt;ck1&gt; &lt;ck2&gt;

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> To Sample Quaternions from a CK File
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   To sample orientation provided in a CK file and print it as SPICE-style
   quaternions, run FRMDIFF as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   % frmdiff -k &lt;lsk&gt; &lt;sclk&gt; &lt;fk&gt; -t dumpqs -s &lt;step&gt; &lt;ck&gt;
</PRE>
   where ``&lt;lsk&gt;'', ``&lt;sclk&gt;'', ``&lt;fk&gt;'', and
   ``&lt;ck&gt;'' are the names of LSK, SCLK, FK, and CK files (all four
   are required); ``-t dumpqs'' sets the output format to the SPICE-style
   quaternion dump; and ``step'' is the time step, in seconds. The
   program's output can be re-directed to a file using the ``&gt;'' pipe.
   To print output time tags as UTC in ISO date format, add
<P>
 
<PRE>
   -f 'YYYY-MM-DDTHR:MN:SC.### ::RND'
</PRE>
   before ``-k''. To use the ``other''-style quaternion dump instead of the
   SPICE-style quaternion dump, replace ``dumpqs'' with ``dumpqo''. To
   include angular velocities, add ``-a yes'' before ``-s''; to print
   angular velocities in the structure frame rather than the base frame,
   also add ``-m to'', like this (the command line below is wrapped to fit
   the page width):
<P>
 
<PRE>
   % frmdiff -k &lt;lsk&gt; &lt;sclk&gt; &lt;fk&gt; -t dumpqo -a yes -m to
             -s &lt;step&gt; &lt;ck&gt;
</PRE>

<A NAME="To Compute Transformation Between Two Frames"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> To Compute Transformation Between Two Frames
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   To compute transformation from one frame known to SPICE to another frame
   known to SPICE and display this transformation as Euler angles, run
   FRMDIFF as follows (the command line below is wrapped to fit the page
   width):
<P>
 
<PRE>
   % frmdiff -k &lt;kernels&gt; -t dumpea
             -b &lt;begintime&gt; -e &lt;endtime&gt; -s &lt;step&gt;
             -f1 &lt;from_frame&gt; -t1 &lt;to_frame&gt;
</PRE>
   where ``&lt;kernels&gt;'' are the names of kernel files needed to
   compute the transformation (an LSK must be included); ``-t dumpea'' sets
   the output format to the Euler angles dump; ``&lt;begintime&gt;'' and
   ``&lt;endtime&gt;'' set the begin and end time, as UTC, for the period
   of interest; ``step'' is the time step, in seconds; and
   ``&lt;from_frame&gt;'' and ``&lt;to_frame&gt;'' are the names of the
   frames from which and to which the transformation can be computed. For
   lengthy reports the program's output should be re-directed to a file
   using the ``&gt;'' pipe.
<P>
 
   Note that if the ``&lt;to_frame&gt;'' is a CK-based (Class 3) or
   PCK-based (Class 2) frame, the list of kernels (``&lt;kernels&gt;'')
   includes CKs or binary PCKs providing data for that frame, and ``-b
   &lt;begintime&gt; -e &lt;endtime&gt;'' are omitted, the program will
   automatically determine the ``&lt;to_frame&gt;''s data availability time
   window and will compute transformations with specified step over that
   whole window.

   For a successful run the program must be supplied with kernel files
   providing sufficient data to compute the frame transformation(s) of
   interest, and with control parameters clearly specifying, together with
   default values determined from the kernels, what transformations should
   be computed and at what times. Both the kernels and the control
   parameters are provided to the program using command line options.

<A NAME="Kernel Files"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Kernel Files
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   In most cases one or more kernel files must be provided to the program
   to perform comparison or sampling of frame orientations. Depending on
   how the kernel files are provided, they fall into one of two categories
   -- primary kernel files and additional kernel files.
<P>
 
   Primary kernel files -- two, one, or none -- are provided at the end of
   the command line without any command line keys. Normally these kernel
   files contain orientations that differ (for example, predicted and
   reconstructed CKs for the same frame and time period, two versions of an
   FK with different alignment data for the same frame, etc.), or contain
   orientation to be sampled. These kernel files are also examined by the
   program to determine the default values for the ``from'', ``to'', and
   ``cov'' frames, and to determine the coverage window boundaries. Note
   that becasue the program slightly contracts coverage windows determined
   from CK files to compensate for roundoff occuring in SCLK to ET time
   conversions, in general FRMDIFF cannot be used to sample or compare CKs
   with discrete data, e.g. Type 1 CKs or Type 3 CKs with singleton
   intervals. For additional discussion of this limitation see the
   ``Coverage Window'' section below.
<P>
 
   Additional kernel files -- none, or as many as needed -- are provided
   anywhere on the command line (except at the very end) using the ``-k'',
   ``-k1'', and ``-k2'' keys. Normally these kernel files contain
   additional SPICE data needed to compute requested orientations (for
   example, LSK and SCLK files providing supporting time conversion data,
   FK files providing frame definitions needed by SPICE to recognize
   specified frames, etc).
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Primary Kernel Files"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Primary Kernel Files
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The primary kernels can be of any type -- CK, PCK, FK, SCLK, LSK or even
   SPK -- and are provided as the last or the last two items on the command
   line. Since the primary kernel files do not require specific command
   line keys, the program determines if they were given by examining the
   last two words on the command line as follows:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> If the last word on the command line is not the name of an existing file,
the program assumes that no primary kernel files were given.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> If the last word on the command line is the name of an existing file but
the second to last word is not, the program assumes that only one primary
kernel was given.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> If both last two words are names of existing files, the program assumes
that it was given two primary kernel files
<BR><BR></UL>
   Due to the parsing approach described above, misspelling a primary
   kernel name leads to the program deciding that it either runs with no
   primary kernel files (if the last file name is misspelled) or that it
   runs with one primary kernel instead of two (if the second to last file
   name is misspelled). In either case, the misspelled file name(s) is(are)
   treated as a part of the value of the command line option immediately
   preceding it(them) causing the program to signal an error indicating an
   incorrect option value.
<P>
 
   On the other hand, if any of the options for specifying additional
   kernel files (``-k'', ``-k1'', ``-k2'') followed by actual files names
   is provided at the end of the command line (for the case of no primary
   kernels) or immediately preceding the only primary file (for one primary
   kernel case), the last one or the last two additional kernels are
   mistakenly picked as the primary kernel(s). In this situation the
   program usually signals an error indicating that orientation could not
   be computed because insufficient data was loaded.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Additional Kernel Files"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Additional Kernel Files
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   As for primary kernels, additional kernels can also be of any type --
   CK, PCK, FK, SCLK, LSK or even SPK. Unlike primary kernels, additional
   kernels are specified using the dedicated ``-k'', ``-k1'', and ``-k2''
   keys. Any number of additional kernels can be provided using any of the
   three keys, with kernel file names listed in any order, separated by
   blanks. While in some rare cases no additional kernel files are
   required, in most cases at least an LSK file and an SCLK file containing
   time correlation data and an FK file containing frame definitions should
   be specified using these keys. The additional kernels are used by the
   program as follows:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> All additional kernel files provided using the ``-k'' are loaded and used
for both ``from''-``to'' frame combinations.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> All additional kernel files provided using ``-k1'' are loaded and used only
for the first ``from''-``to'' frame combination.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> All additional kernel files provided using ``-k2'' are loaded and used only
for the second ``from''-``to'' frame combination.
<BR><BR></UL>
   Neither the combined set of additional kernel files given using
   ``-k''/``-k1'' nor the combined set of additional kernel files given
   using ``-k''/``-k2'' can contain enough data to compute corresponding
   orientations at any time in the time buffer without loading the
   corresponding primary file(s). If they do, the program signals an error.
   The two exceptions from this requirement are:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> when no primary kernel files are specified the additional kernel files
given using ``-k''/``-k1'' and ``-k''/``-k2'' should contain enough data to
compute the corresponding orientations
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> when both ``from'' and ``to'' frames in one or both``from''-``to'' frame
pairs are built-in frames, the check for inability to compute orientations
without loading primary kernel files is skipped

<H2> Comparison Runs vs. Sampling Runs

   The program automatically decides whether it should compare two
   orientations or sample one orientation, based on the primary kernels
   provided at the end of the command line, additional kernel files
   provided using the ``-k1'' and ``-k2'' keys, and on the ``from'' and
   ``to'' frames specified on the command line using the ``-f1'', ``-t1'',
   ``-f2'', and ``-t2'' keys and/or determined from the primary kernel
   data.
<P>
 
   To run the program in comparison mode, it is enough to satisfy any of
   the following guidelines for specifying inputs that tell the program to
   compute two different orientations:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> provide two different primary kernels

<BR><BR></UL>
   To run the program in sampling mode, it is required to satisfy all of
   the following guidelines telling the program to compute a single
   orientation:

<H2> ``From'', ``To'', and ``Coverage'' Frames

   The program has six command line keys -- ``-f1'', ``-t1'', ``-c1'',
   ``-f2'', ``-t2'', and ``-c2'' -- to specify frames to be used to compute
   rotations (``-f*'' and ``-t*'' keys) and to determine coverage from
   primary or additional CK or binary PCK files (``-c*'' keys). A single
   frame can be specified using each of these keys using the frame name,
   frame ID, or frame class ID (only for runs with primary kernel files
   that are CKs or binary PCKs).
<P>
 
   Whether the frame is specified by the name, ID, or class ID, it must be
   known to SPICE, i.e. it must either be a built-in frame or one of the
   frames defined in the FK file(s) provided as primary or additional
   kernels. If the frame name, ID, or class ID specified on the command
   line or picked from the primary file is not recognized after loading the
   kernel files provided using ``-k''/``-k1'' and the first primary file
   for the ``-*1'' frames, or provided using ``-k''/``-k2'' and the second
   primary file for the ``-*2'' frames, the program signals an error.
<P>
 
   Not all six frames have to be specified for every program run. In fact
   in many cases only one, two, or even no frames can be given and the
   program will set the rest to default values based on the other frames
   that are provided and/or by examining the primary kernel files. The

<H2> Times for Comparison/Sampling
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The program picks times at which orientation(s) are computed based on
   the coverage window determined by examining the primary or additional
   files(s) and/or specified using the ``-b'' and ``-e'' keys, and on
   either the number of points within that window specified using the
   ``-n'' key or the time step specified using the ``-s'' key''.
<P>
 
   The coverage window begin and end times specified using the ``-b'' and
   ``-e'' options can be in any format accepted by SPICE's <a href="../cspice/str2et_c.html">str2et_c</a>
   function (see <a href="../cspice/str2et_c.html">str2et_c</a> header for details). If one or both of these
   times are provided, an LSK file must be provided as one of the
   additional or primary kernels.
<P>
 
   The number of points specified using the ``-n'' key must be an integer
   between 1 to 1,000,000 while the step specified using the ``-s'' key
   must be in seconds and be greater than 1.0E-8. If both ``-n'' and ``-s''
   are specified, ``-s'' takes precedence.
<P>
 
   The coverage window determined by examining the primary or additional
   kernels -- especially if these kernels are CK files, which frequently
   have gaps in coverage -- may consist of many intervals, some of which
   may be singletons (with the interval begin time equal to the interval
   end time). Whether the coverage window consists of only one interval or
   of many intervals, the program computes times within the window in such
   a way that the interval ends are always included in the set of points.
   The rest of times are distributed within the intervals, stepping from
   the beginning of each interval with the specified step. If the number of
   points is given instead of the step, the step is computed using the
   measure of the coverage window (the sum of the lengths of the individual
   intervals) and the specified number of points.
<P>
 
   Not all of the keys controlling selection of points have to be specified
   for every program run. In some cases none of these options are required;
   in the other cases ``-b'', ``-e'', ``-c1'', and/or ``-c2'' must be
   specified. The two subsections below discuss specifics of providing and
   picking defaults for the coverage window and step or number of points.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Coverage Window"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Coverage Window
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The program determines the coverage window either by examining the
   primary or additional kernels (resulting in the ``default coverage
   window''), or by using the begin and end times specified using the
   ``-b'' and ``-e'' keys, or as a combination of both.
<P>
 
   The default coverage window can be determined only from the primary or
   additional kernel files that are binary PCK files (using SPICE's
   <a href="../cspice/pckcov_c.html">pckcov_c</a> function) or CK files (using SPICE's <a href="../cspice/ckcov_c.html">ckcov_c</a> function) and only
   if these kernels contain data for the ``coverage'' frames either
   specified using the ``-c1''/``-c2'' keys or set to default values as
   described earlier in this document. When both ``coverage'' frames are
   specified or set to default values, the program determines the
   frame-specific coverage window for each of them using the corresponding
   primary or additional kernels and sets the default coverage window to
   the intersection of these two frame-specific coverage windows. When only
   one ``coverage'' frame is specified or set to the default value, the
   program determines the frame-specific coverage window for that frame
   using corresponding primary or additional kernels and sets the default
   coverage window to that frame-specific coverage window.
<P>
 
   In cases when a frame-specific coverage window is obtained from the
   corresponding primary kernel, the program examines only that primary
   kernel to construct the desired frame-specific coverage window. In cases
   when a frame-specific coverage window is obtained from additional
   kernels, the program examines all kernels of a particular type -- all
   CKs if the ``coverage'' frame is a CK-based frame or all binary PCKs if
   the ``coverage'' frame is a PCK-based frame -- listed explicitly with
   the ``-k''/``-k1'' or ``-k''/``-k2'' keys or included in meta-kernels
   provided with these keys and constructs the frame-specific coverage
   window as the union of coverages obtained from individual additional
   kernels.
<P>
 
   When the program determines the coverage window for a CK file it
   slightly contracts the actual coverage window given by the CK data to
   compensate for roundoff occuring in SCLK-ET time conversions. The
   contraction is done by adjusting inward the window interval boundary
   times by three times the amout of maximum roundoff that was determined
   by converting all boundary times from SCLK to ET then back to SCLK. This
   adjustment is done to ensure that the program is able to compute
   orientation at any time within the comparison or sampling time domain
   using the high level SPICE frames routines (<a href="../cspice/pxform_c.html">pxform_c</a> and <a href="../cspice/sxform_c.html">sxform_c</a>).
   While this contraction does not have any noticable effect when the
   program is run with CKs containing continuous data, it makes the program
   unuseable with CKs containing disrete data -- Type 1 CKs and Type 3 CKs
   with singleton intervals -- because such contraction eliminates all
   singleton intervals corresponding to the discrete time point from the
   comparison window. The error messages that the program would display in
   such cases say that CK files do not provide any roundoff-adjusted
   coverage for a particular CK-based frame. An exception to this
   limitation is the rare ciscumstance when SCLK-ET time conversions have
   no round off; in such cases the program will work on CKs containing
   discrete data.
<P>
 
   If the default coverage window was determined from primary or additional
   kernel file(s) and either ``-b'' or ``-e'', or both ``-b'' and ``-e''
   were specified, it is truncated according to these begin and end times.
   If the time specified using ``-b'' is before the start of the default
   window, this time is ignored. If the time specified using ``-b'' is
   after the end of the default coverage window, the program signals an
   error. If the time specified using ``-e'' is after the end of the
   default window, this time is ignored. If the time specified using ``-e''
   is before the start of the default coverage window, the program signals
   an error.
<P>
 
   If no ``coverage'' frames are specified or set by default, or if one or
   both ``coverage'' frames are given but corresponding primary or
   additional kernels don't contain any data for them, both the coverage
   window begin time and the coverage window end time must be specified
   using the ``-b'' and ``-e'' keys because the program has no way to
   determining the default coverage window. If either ``-b'' or ``-e'' is
   not provided in such cases, the program signals an error.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Times within Coverage Window"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Times within Coverage Window
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The program picks times within the coverage window based on the number
   of points specified using the ``-n'' key or the time step specified
   using the ``-s'' key''.
<P>
 
   When neither the number of points is specified using ``-n'' nor the step
   is specified using ``-s'', the number of points is set to a default
   value determined by examining the coverage window. If the total number
   of endpoints -- 2 for each non-singleton interval, 1 for each singleton
   interval -- for all intervals in the coverage window is greater than
   1000, the number of points is set to the number of endpoints and the
   step is not computed. Otherwise it is set to 1000 or a number less than
   but close to 1000 (the actual number is determined at run-time based on
   the lengths of the intervals) and the step is computed by dividing the
   measure of the coverage window by the number of points minus the number
   of endpoints.
<P>
 
   When the number of points is specified using ``-n'' but this number is
   less than the number of the coverage window interval endpoints, the
   value given using ``-n'' is ignored and the number of points is set to
   the number of interval endpoints and the step is not computed. Otherwise
   the number of points is set to the value provided using ``-n'' or a
   number less than but close to this value (the actual number is
   determined at run time based on the lengths of the intervals) and the
   step is computed by dividing the measure of the coverage window by the
   number of points minus the number of endpoints.
<P>
 
   When step is specified using ``-s'', the number of points is computed by
   adding the number of interval endpoints to the total of the numbers of
   points that can fit within each non-singleton interval when it's stepped
   through with this step. If the resultant number of points is greater
   than 1,000,000, the program signals an error.
<P>
 
   Whether the step was provided or computed using the provided or default
   number of points, the set of times at which orientation is computed
   includes all interval ends -- 2 for each non-singleton interval, 1 for
   each singleton interval -- plus additional points computed by stepping
   with this step within each non-singleton interval starting from the
   interval start time. The last point within each non-singleton interval
   is computed such that it always lies inside the 1.5*step to 0.5*step
   range off the interval end.
<P>
 
   Care should be taken when picking the step using ``-s'' or specifying
   the number of points using ``-n''. Picking a very small step for a large
   time window, or very many points for any window, leads to very long run
   times. In some cases the number of points computed using the step may
   even be greater that 1,000,000, preventing the program from running
   because its buffers are not large enough to deal with so many points. On
   the other hand, picking a large step or too few points prevents the
   program from doing a thorough comparison.

<H2> Angular Velocities

   The ``-a'' key is used to tell the program to compute angular velocities
   in addition to orientations. When the value provided using ``-a'' is
   ``yes'', the program computes angular velocities and reports them or
   their differences along with the orientation or orientation differences.
   If the key is omitted or set to ``no'', the program does not compute
   angular velocities. For any value other than ``yes'' or ``no'' the
   program reports an error.
<P>
 
   If the program samples or compares angular velocities (``-a yes''), the
   ``-m'' key is used to specify whether they or their differences should
   be reported in the ``from'' frame(s) or the ``to'' frame(s). When the
   value provided using the ``-m'' key is ``to'', the program reports
   angular velocities or their differences in the ``to'' frames. If the key
   is omitted or set to ``from'', the program reports angular velocities or
   their differences in the ``from'' frames. For any value other than
   ``to'' or ``from'' the program reports an error.
<P>
 
   In order for the program to compute angular velocities the data provided
   to it must support this computation. This is not an issue for any frames
   except for CK-based frames. Therefore, when using CK files, whether as
   primary or as additional kernels, it's important to make sure that these
   CKs include angular velocities before requesting the program to compute
   angular velocities.

   differences of two transformations (in comparison runs) or information
   about a single transformation (for sampling runs) in various formats as
   a function of time, for analysis or use in other applications. The
   ``dumpc'' and ``dumpg'' reports are useful for CK or binary PCK coverage
   overlap analysis.

   When one of the SCLK formats (``sclk'', ``sclkd'', ``ticks'') is
   specified, TDB times used internally by the program are converted to
   SCLK times using the SCLK ID associated with one of the ``to'' or
   ``coverage'' CK-based frames in the following priority order (from
   highest to lowest): first ``to'' frame, first ``coverage'' frame, second
   ``to'' frame, second ``coverage'' frame. If neither of the ``to'' or
   ``coverage'' frames is a CK frame, the program signals an error.
<P>
 
   When decimal SCLK tags are requested, the SCLK string returned by
   SPICE's <a href="../cspice/sce2s_c.html">sce2s_c</a> function is converted to ``decimal'' SCLK by stripping
   off the partition, using the left field as the integer part and
   converting the rest of the fields to the decimal fraction of the left
   field using the SCLK field values from the string SCLK and SCLK moduli
   and offsets from the SCLK kernel file. For example, the SCLK string
   ``1/883612839.255'' that has seconds in the left field and a count of
   ticks having duration of 1/256 of a second in the right field is
   converted to this DP SCLK 883612839.996094. This conversion is supported

   When one of the numeric formats (``et'', ``sclkd'', ``ticks'') is
   specified, times are displayed in the scientific format with 14
   significant digits (e.g. +1.2345678901234E+01), unless ``-d'' is used to
   specify a different number of significant digits.
<P>
 
   ``-f'' does not apply to times in the report header and the statistics
   report, in which the times are always displayed as TDBs in calendar and
   seconds past J2000 numeric (in scientific format with 14 significant
   digits) formats.

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Numeric Format for ``dump*'' Reports
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The default format of numeric time tags (TDB seconds past J2000, decimal
   SCLKs and encoded SCLK ticks), rotation and angular velocity component
   values, and rotation and angular velocity difference component values in
   all ``dump*'' reports is the scientific format with 14 significant
   digits (e.g. +1.2345678901234E+01). A different number of significant
   digits can be specified using the ``-d'' option as an integer in the
   range from 6 to 17. If specified, the number of significant digits is
   used for all numeric items in the ``dump*'' report data part (table) but
   is not used for any numbers in the table header or in the data part of
   the non-``dump*'' (``basic'' and ``stats'') reports.
<P>
 
   The default format, with 14 significant digits, is usually adequate for
   output from all comparison runs and from all sampling runs that are
   intended to produce tables of rotations or rotation differences for
   plotting but, due to round off, it may not be adequate for sampling runs
   that are intended to generate tables of quaternions, angles, or matrices
   for subsequent interpolation or packaging into CK files. For such
   outputs the number of significant digits should be increased to 16 -- if
   output rotations are planned to be packaged into an CK file using the
   MSOPCK program that employs a custom parser to ingest input numeric data
   -- or 17 -- if output rotations will read by an application that uses
   language-native means to parse input numeric data.

   The statistics report provides a small set of statistical information on
   the difference of two frame transformations (for comparison runs) or a
   single transformation (for sampling runs). It includes the same items as
   the basic report (maximums and averages) plus a few additional
   parameters such as RMS of the rotation angle difference/angle and
   angular velocity difference/angular velocity and the times when the
   maximum value of the rotation angle difference/angle and angular
   velocity difference/angular velocity were found.

   The orientation difference expressed as the rotation angle (column 2)
   can be plotted against TDB seconds (column 1) for analysis.
<P>
 
   Note that the time window shown in the report header is different from
   the requested window specified using the ``-b'' and ``-e'' options. The
   reason for that is the lack of coverage for the requested windows in one
   of the CKs (``09009_09025pa_fsiv_lud2.bc'').
<P>
 
   To find out when the difference between two orientations is the greatest
   without plotting the difference as suggested above, the program can be
   re-run with the same options to generate a statistics report (``-t
   stats''). For such a run it makes sense to also decrease the time step
   in order to determine the time of interest more accurately, for example
   by setting the step to 1 second (``-s 1'').

   In this example the program is run to assess the effect that using an
   out-of-date SCLK kernel has on the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft
   orientation computed from the M01 CK file ``m01_sc_2009-01-27.bc''. To
   make the program run in comparison mode, the current SCLK
   ``ORB1_SCLKSCET.00157.tsc'' and the out-of-date SCLK
   ``ORB1_SCLKSCET.00147.tsc'' are provided using the ``-k1'' and ``-k2''
   keys while the CK is provided as the only primary kernel.
   (Alternatively, the SCLK kernels could be provided as two primary
   kernels while the CK could be provided using the ``-k'' key, in which
   case the ``from'' and ``to'' frames and the coverage boundaries would
   have to be specified because the program would not be able to determine
   defaults from the SCLK kernels.) The LSK ``naif0009.tls'', required to
   support time conversions, and the FK ``m01_v28.tf'', required because it
   defines the M01 spacecraft frame, are provided using the ``-k'' key. The
   angle and axis dump report is requested using ``-t dumpaa'' and the step
   size is set to 10 seconds using ``-s 10''. No other options need to be
   specified because the primary kernel is a CK, which the program can
   examine to automatically pick the ``from'' and ``to'' frames and the
   default coverage window. The program's output is re-directed to the file
   ``output.txt'' using the ``&gt;'' shell pipe, with the contents of the

   In this example the program is run to compare Earth orientations
   provided by the high precision Earth orientation binary PCK file
   ``earth_000101_090421_090128.bpc'' and the low precision Earth
   orientation text PCK file ``pck00008.tpc''. The PCK files are specified
   as two primary kernels to make the program run in comparison mode. For
   this run both ``to'' frames must be specified because the frame
   associated with the high precision orientation -- ``ITRF93'' -- is
   different from the frame associated with the low precision orientation
   -- ``IAU_EARTH''. These two frames are provided using the ``-t1'' and
   ``-t2'' keys. Note that neither the coverage boundaries nor the ``from''
   frames need to be specified because the program can set them to default
   values obtained by examining the binary PCK. The step is set to 1 hour
   (``-s 3600'') and the report type is picked to be the Euler angle dump
   (``-t dumpea'') with the rotation axis order Z,Y,X (``-o z y x'').
   Reporting differences as Euler angles might be desirable in this case
   because the angles will show how much of the difference is in the pole
   tilt (combination of angles about X and Y) and how much of it is in the

   In this example the program is run to print the rotation from the

   ``ECLIPJ2000'' is specified using ``-t1''. While it may seem that no
   kernels would be needed in this case, it is not true. An LSK must be
   provided to the program because the time at which the orientation should
   be computed must be provided on the command line twice using the ``-b''
   and ``-e'' keys and this time has to be converted to TDB inside the
   program. Therefore the program is given the LSK ``naif0009.tls'' using
   the ``-k'' option and an arbitrary time (``2000-01-01'') twice using the

   Even though the program has the flexibility to compare any two
   transformations -- for example the transformation from the ``J2000''
   frame to the ``IAU_MARS'' frame with the transformation from the
   ``MRO_SPACECRAFT'' frame to the ``MRO_CTX'' frame -- it doesn't mean
   that such comparisons make sense. In general, it makes sense to compare
   only transformations that are close to each other and have the same

   While Euler angles included in the Euler angles dump report (``-t
   dumpea'') may be one of the more intuitive representations of rotations,
   in many cases, depending on the rotation order, the angle magnitudes can
   be large and not representative of the small rotation differences. The
   total rotation angle provided in the rotation angle and axis report
   (``-t dumpaa'') is a much more reliable indicator of the difference of
   two rotations.

   Due to the algorithm which the program uses to determine the coverage
