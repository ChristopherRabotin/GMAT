   The SPICE rotation routines manipulate and convert between different
   representations of rotation transformations: matrices, quaternions,
   Euler angles, and axis-angle pairs.

<A NAME="Introduction"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Introduction
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   This document covers the CSPICE routines that deal with rotations and
   the mathematical ideas behind the routines.
<P>
 
   There are three chapters:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> CSPICE routines
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>&#32;&#32;</TT> The ``CSPICE routines'' chapter tells you what routines are available, what
they do, and how to call them.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Tutorial introduction to rotations
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>&#32;&#32;</TT> If rotations are new to you, you'll profit most by reading the ``tutorial''
chapter first. This chapter lists most of the facts about rotations used in
the CSPICE code. The emphasis is on building intuition about rotations;
proofs of any noticeable difficulty or length are deferred to the
``Mathematical Road Map'' chapter.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Mathematical road map
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>&#32;&#32;</TT> This chapter contains detailed explanations of a number of the mathematical
ideas used in the CSPICE rotation routines. And as we've said, proofs of
some of assertions made in the tutorial chapter are stowed here.
<BR><BR></UL>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Using this document"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Using this document
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   For many readers, the first chapter will be the only one of interest.
   The mechanics of using the rotation routines in your code are covered
   here.
<P>
 
   The rest of the document covers the ideas behind the code. This material
   is meant to be used as a reference rather than to be read from start to
   finish; the topics are ordered loosely according to logical dependence,
   but there is no narrative progression from section to section.
<P>
 
   The purpose of the tutorial and ``road map'' chapters is to make it
   easier to be certain that you're using the code correctly. In our
   experience, thinking about this category of code only in terms of
   ``inputs'' and ``outputs'' is a tricky and error-prone approach; really
   understanding the mathematics helps you to verify that you're putting
   the pieces together in ways that make sense.
<P>
 
   Because some of the ideas required to understand the code seem to exist
   as lore and are rarely written down, we've collected them here for your
   convenience.

   About angles: all angles in this document are measured in radians.

   About directions: the ``right hand rule'' is in effect at all times in

<H3> Finding Euler angles that represent a matrix
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Given a rotation matrix `m' and three coordinate axes indexed by the
   integers i[2], i[1], i[0], the function <a href="../cspice/m2eul_c.html">m2eul_c</a> finds angles ang[2],
   ang[1], ang[0] such that
<P>
 
<PRE>
   m   =   [ang[2]]       [ang[1]]        [ang[0]]    .
                   i[2]           i[1]            i[0]
</PRE>
   The call
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/m2eul_c.html">m2eul_c</a> ( m, i[2], i[1], i[0], ang+2, ang+1, ang );
</PRE>
   returns the desired angles. <a href="../cspice/m2eul_c.html">m2eul_c</a> restricts the ranges of the output
   angles so as to guarantee that the Euler angle representation is unique.
   The output angles ang[2] and ang[0] are always in the range (-pi,pi].
   The range of ang[1] is determined by the set of rotation axes. When i[2]
   equals i[0], ang[1] is in the range [0, pi]. Otherwise, ang[1] is in the
   range [-pi/2, pi/2]. These ranges make unique determinations of Euler
   angles possible, except in degenerate cases.
<P>
 
   In cases where the Euler angles are not uniquely determined, <a href="../cspice/eul2m_c.html">eul2m_c</a>
   sets the first angle (called ang[2] above) to zero. The other two angles
   are then uniquely determined.
<P>
 
   Again, the indices i[2], i[1], i[0] are members of
<P>
 
<PRE>
   {1, 2, 3}.
</PRE>
   There is a restriction on the allowed set of coordinate axes: i[1] must
   not equal i[2] or i[0]. If this constraint is not met, the desired
   representation of `m' by Euler angles may not exist; <a href="../cspice/m2eul_c.html">m2eul_c</a> signals an
   error in this case.

<H3> Programming hazards
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   There are several pitfalls associated with converting matrices to Euler
   angles. First, any mapping from matrices to Euler angles has
   singularities. These come in two flavors: some matrices don't map to a
   unique set of Euler angles, and some matrices have the property that a
   small change in the matrix can result in a large change in the
   corresponding Euler angles.
<P>
 
   The first category of singularity occurs with matrices that represent
   rotations about the first or third axis in the sequence of rotation axes
   (for example, axis 3 for a 2-1-3 rotation). In practical terms, if
   <a href="../cspice/eul2m_c.html">eul2m_c</a> encounters one of these special matrices, eul2m_c must choose
   the Euler angles. Immediately the possibility arises that <a href="../cspice/eul2m_c.html">eul2m_c</a> will
   disagree with any other code performing the same task.
<P>
 
   The second kind of singularity occurs when any of the Euler angles
   corresponding to a matrix is at one of the endpoints of its range, for
   example, when the first angle has the value pi. If the matrix is
   perturbed slightly, the first angle may jump from pi to a value close to
   -pi. Again, two different pieces of code may give different results in
   such a case, merely because of round-off error. Euler angles near the
   limits of their ranges should be regarded with suspicion.
<P>
 
   The existence of singularities in the matrix-to-Euler angle mapping
   prevents <a href="../cspice/eul2m_c.html">eul2m_c</a> and <a href="../cspice/m2eul_c.html">m2eul_c</a> from being exact inverses: most of the
   time, the code fragment
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/eul2m_c.html">eul2m_c</a> (    ang[2],  ang[1],  ang[0],
                axis[2], axis[1], axis[0], m );
 
   <a href="../cspice/m2eul_c.html">m2eul_c</a> ( m, axis[2], axis[1], axis[0],
                ang+2,   ang+1,   ang        );
</PRE>
   leaves the angles ang[2], ang[1], ang[0] unchanged, except for round-off
   error, but in some cases, the angles may change drastically.
<P>
 
   If we reverse the order of the function calls in the last code fragment,
   the matrix `m' should be preserved, except for errors due to loss of
   precision. The loss of precision can be considerable, though, for
   matrices whose entries are nearly those of any degenerate case matrix.

   Some care is needed when dealing with signs of rotation angles: a
   rotation of a vector by an angle `theta' can be viewed as rotating the
   coordinate system by -`theta'. We try to avoid confusion here by
   referring to routines as ``coordinate system rotations'' or ``vector
   rotations,'' depending on whether a positive rotation angle corresponds
   to rotating the coordinate system by a positive angle, or to rotating a
   vector by a positive angle. The same criterion applies to matrix
   rotations. According to this classification, <a href="../cspice/rotvec_c.html">rotvec_c</a> and <a href="../cspice/rotmat_c.html">rotmat_c</a>
   perform coordinate rotations, and <a href="../cspice/vrotv_c.html">vrotv_c</a> performs a vector rotation.

   <a href="../cspice/raxisa_c.html">raxisa_c</a> and <a href="../cspice/axisar_c.html">axisar_c</a> can be used to perform linear interpolation
   between two rotation matrices. Here's a code fragment illustrating the
   procedure:
<P>
 
<PRE>
      /*
      Let r(t) be a time-varying rotation matrix; r could be
      a C-matrix describing the orientation of a spacecraft
      structure.  Given two points in time t1 and t2 at which
      r(t) is known, and given a third time t3, where
 
         t1  &lt;  t3  &lt;  t2,
 
      we can estimate r(t3) by linear interpolation.  In other
      words, we approximate the motion of r by pretending that
      r rotates about a fixed axis at a uniform angular rate
      during the time interval [t1, t2].  More specifically, we
      assume that each column vector of r rotates in this
      fashion.  This procedure will not work if r rotates through
      an angle of pi radians or more during the time interval
      [t1, t2]; an aliasing effect would occur in that case.
 
      If we let
 
         r1 = r(t1)
         r2 = r(t2), and
 
                     -1
         q  = r2 * r1  ,
 
      then the rotation axis and angle of q define the rotation
      that each column of r(t) undergoes from time t1 to time

   Transforming state vectors between inertial and non-inertial coordinates
   requires the derivative of the rotation that relates the two frames: Let
<P>
 
<PRE>
   p (t)
    I
</PRE>
   be a position vector referenced to an inertial frame ``I,'' and let
<P>
 
<PRE>
   p (t)
    N
</PRE>
   be the equivalent position vector referenced to a non-inertial frame
   ``N.'' If r(t) is the transformation from frame I to N at time t, then
   the two vectors are related as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   p (t)  =  r(t) p (t)
    N              I
</PRE>
   Therefore, the derivatives of the position vectors satisfy
<P>
 
<PRE>
   d [ p (t) ]               d [ p (t) ]
        N                         I              d [ r(t) ]

</PRE>
   It's well to note that although `r'(t) may vary slowly, the second term
   in the above equation is not necessarily insignificant. For example, if
   `r'(t) describes a transformation between an inertial frame and a
   body-centered frame that uses a body-center-to-Sun vector to define one
   of its coordinate axes, then for any point that is fixed on this axis,
   the two addends above have equal and opposite magnitude. In particular,
   if the fixed point is the location of the Sun, the magnitude of the
   second addend is (ignoring the velocity of the Sun with respect to the
   inertial frame) that of the inertially referenced velocity of the body
   used to define the body-centered frame.
<P>
 
   CSPICE provides routines to transform states between inertial frames and
   body-fixed planetocentric frames. The routine <a href="../cspice/tisbod_c.html">tisbod_c</a> returns the 6x6
   transformation matrix required to transform inertially referenced state
   vectors to body-fixed planetocentric coordinates. If `ref' is the name
   of the inertial frame of interest, `body' is the NAIF integer code of a
   body defining a body-fixed planetocentric frame, and `et' is ephemeris
   time used to define the body-fixed frame, then the call
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/tisbod_c.html">tisbod_c</a> ( ref, body, et, tsipm );

   returns `tsipm', the desired 6x6 state transformation matrix. A state

<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/mxvg_c.html">mxvg_c</a> ( tsipm, s, 6, 6, sbfixd );

   transpose, CSPICE provides the utility routine <a href="../cspice/invstm_c.html">invstm_c</a> to perform the

   In this section, we make some assertions that we don't prove. Our goal
   is to supply you with the most important information first, and fill in
   the details later. Proofs are supplied only when they're instructive and
   not too distracting. The longer or more difficult proofs are deferred to

   If you're going to read the rest of this tutorial, you're going to see a
   lot of definitions, symbol manipulation, and proofs. This information
   may be more accessible if you have some kind of reasonable mental model
   of rotations; then you can test our claims against your model.
<P>
 
   We offer the following model: Take a soccer ball, put two fingers on
   diametrically opposed points on the ball, and rotate the ball through
   some angle, keeping your fingers in place. What you use to rotate the
   ball is up to you.
<P>
 
   Well, that's it. That's the effect of a rotation on a soccer ball. Now
   you're equipped to answer some questions about rotations. Do rotations
   preserve inner products of vectors? That is, is it true that for vectors
   u and v, and a rotation R,
<P>
 
<PRE>
   &lt; R u,  R v &gt;  =  &lt; u, v &gt; ?
</PRE>
   Well, presume that your soccer ball is centered at the origin, and mark
   the ball where u and v, or extensions of them, intercept the surface
   (perhaps you could hold a marker pen between your teeth). Does rotating
   the ball change the angular separation of the marks? No. So rotations
   preserve angular separation. Does rotating the ball change the norm of u
   or of v? No. So rotations preserve both angular separation and norms,
   and hence inner products.
<P>
 
   Do rotations preserve cross products? For vectors u and v, is it true
   that
<P>
 
<PRE>
   ( R u )  x  ( R v )  =  R ( u x v )?
</PRE>
   Mark the intercepts of u, v, and u x v on the soccer ball. After you
   rotate the ball, does the intercept mark of u x v still lie at the right
   place, relative to the u and v intercept marks? Yes. Since we already
   know that rotations preserve norms, we can conclude that they preserve
   cross products as well.
<P>
 
   The soccer ball model shows that rotations preserve geometrical
   relationships between vectors.

   So rotations really do preserve inner products. In particular, for any

   If we multiply a sequence of rotation matrices, is the result a rotation
   matrix? Equivalently, if we compose a sequence of rotations, is the
   resulting mapping a rotation?
<P>
 
   What does our soccer ball model say? We can rotate the ball as many
   times as we like, changing the rotation axis each time, without changing
   the distance of any surface point from the center, so norms are
   preserved. Similarly, after marking the intercepts of u, v, and u x v on
   the surface, we can perform any sequence of rotations without changing
   the position of the u x v intercept mark relative to those of u and v.
   So cross products are preserved. That's all we need to verify that the
   composition of a sequence of rotations is a rotation. It follows that
   the product of a sequence of rotation matrices is a rotation matrix.
<P>
 
   If you don't agree that that's all we need, we can present the same

   How do we transform a vector v from one coordinate system to another?
   This result really belongs to linear algebra, but we'll state it here
   because it seems to come up a lot.
<P>
 
   Given two vector space bases,
<P>
 
<PRE>
   B1 = { e1, e2, e3 },   B2 = { u1, u2, u3 },
</PRE>
   and a vector v that has components ( v1, v2, v3 ) relative to B1, we
   wish to express v relative to B2. We can say that
<P>
 
<PRE>
   v  =  x1 u1 +  x2 u2  +  x3 u3,
</PRE>
   where the x's are unknowns. Let M be the matrix whose columns are u1,
   u2, and u3, represented relative to basis B1. M represents the linear
   transformation T defined by
<P>
 
<PRE>
   T  (e1) = u1, T(e2) = u2, T(e3) = u3.
</PRE>
   Then since
<P>
 
<PRE>
    -1         -1
   T  (v)  =  T  ( x1 u1 +  x2 u2  +  x3 u3 )
 
           =     ( x1 e1 +  x2 e2  +  x3 e3 ),
</PRE>
   we see that
<P>
 
<PRE>
    -1
   M  v  = ( x1, x2, x3 ).
</PRE>
   So we've found the components of v, relative to basis B2.
<P>
 
   In the case where B1 and B2 are orthonormal bases, the matrix M is
   orthogonal. So we have
<P>
 
<PRE>
    T
   M  v  = ( x1, x2, x3 ).
</PRE>
   Conversely, if M is the matrix that transforms vectors from orthonormal
   basis B1 to orthonormal basis B2, then the rows of M are the basis
   vectors of B2.
<P>
 
   For example, if M is the matrix that transforms vectors from J2000
   coordinates to body equator and prime meridian coordinates, then the
   first row is the vector, expressed in J2000 coordinates, that points
   from the body center to the intersection of the prime meridian and body
   equator. The third row is the vector, expressed in J2000 coordinates,
   that points from the body center toward the body's north pole.

   How do we rotate a two-dimensional vector v by theta radians? Trivial as
   this problem may seem, it's probably worth your while to get a firm grip
   on its solution. When you've understood it, you've almost understood
   three-dimensional rotations.
<P>
 
   We can assume that v is a unit vector; since rotations are linear, it's
   easy to extend the result to vectors of any length.
<P>
 
   Now, if v is (1,0), the result of the rotation will be
<P>
 
<PRE>
   ( cos(theta),  sin(theta) ).
</PRE>
   How does this help us if v is an arbitrary unit vector? Given a unit
   vector v, let v' be the vector perpendicular to v, obtained by rotating
   v by pi/2. Now v and v' form an orthonormal basis, and relative to this
   basis, v has coordinates (1,0). But we've already found out what we get
   by rotating v by theta radians: relative to our new basis, the result
   must be
<P>
 
<PRE>
   ( cos(theta), sin(theta) ).
</PRE>
   Relative to our original basis, this vector is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   cos(theta) v  +  sin(theta) v'
</PRE>
   This is the result we're looking for: ``If you rotate a vector v by
   theta radians, you end up with cos(theta) v plus sin(theta) v','' where
   v' is v, rotated by pi/2.
<P>
 
   Scaling v does not affect this result.
<P>
 
   A consequence of this result is that the mapping R that rotates vectors
   by theta radians is represented by the matrix
<P>
 
<PRE>
   +-                        -+

   It is useful to note that R has this exact representation relative to

<H2> A canonical representation for rotations
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Suppose we have a rotation R, defined in three-dimensional space, that
   rotates vectors by angle theta about unit vector n. For an arbitrary
   vector r, we can break r up into two orthogonal components: one parallel
   to n and one perpendicular to n. We can call these components rParallel
   and rPerp.
<P>
 
   The two-dimensional diagram below shows this decomposition. All of the
   vectors lie in the plane containing r and n.
<P>
 
<PRE>
                \           . rParallel
                 \          .
                  \         .
                r  \        .
                    \       .
                     \      .
                      \     .
                       \    ^
                        \   |
                         \  |  n
                          \ |
                 ..........\|
                rPerp
</PRE>
   Now, what does R do to vectors that are perpendicular to n? Since R
   rotates each vector about n, if a vector v is perpendicular to n, then
   R(v) is perpendicular to n as well (remember that rotations preserve
   inner products, and orthogonality in particular). So rPerp just gets
   rotated in the plane perpendicular to n. We know from the last section
   how to find R(rPerp): if we let rPerp' be the vector obtained by
   rotating rPerp by pi/2 about n, then
<P>
 
<PRE>
   R(rPerp) = cos(theta) rPerp  +  sin(theta) rPerp'
</PRE>
   We will also want to know what R(rPerp') is. Since rotating rPerp' by
   pi/2 about n yields -rPerp, applying our familiar formula to rPerp'
   gives us
<P>
 
<PRE>
   R(rPerp') = cos(theta) rPerp'  -  sin(theta) rPerp.
</PRE>
   Now, since n, rPerp, and rPerp' are mutually orthogonal, these vectors
   form a basis. Since we can scale r so that rPerp has norm 1, and since
   rPerp' has the same norm as rPerp, we may assume that the basis is
   actually orthonormal.
<P>
 
   The matrix of R relative to this basis is
<P>
 
<PRE>

   Since the rotation we're representing is arbitrary, we've shown that
   every rotation can be represented by a matrix of the above form.
   Equivalently, every rotation matrix is similar to one of the above form.
   This fact justifies the use of the term ``canonical form.''
<P>
 
   The canonical form we've found shows why three-dimensional rotations are
   very much like two-dimensional rotations: The effect of a
   three-dimensional rotation on any vector is to rotate the component of
   that vector that is normal to the rotation axis, and leave the component
   parallel to the rotation axis fixed.
<P>
 
   This rotation matrix is a useful ``model'' to keep in mind when dealing
   with rotations because of its particularly simple form. It's easy to
   read off some types of information directly from this matrix.
<P>
 
   Some examples:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The trace of the above matrix is 1 + 2 cos(theta). Since the trace of a
matrix is invariant under similarity transformations, every rotation matrix
has trace equal to 1 + 2 cos(theta). So we can easily find the rotation
angle of any rotation matrix.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Every rotation has 1 as one of its eigenvalues. We already knew that, but
there it is, sitting alone in its one-dimensional diagonal block. The other
eigenvalues are complex unless the rotation angle is a multiple of pi.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Every rotation is an orthogonal mapping, that is, orthogonal vectors map to
orthogonal vectors. This has to be true because the canonical form is an
orthogonal matrix, represented relative to an orthonormal basis.

   Our soccer ball model shows that a rotation has a fixed vector, called
   the ``axis.'' Now if the vector n is fixed by R, then -n is fixed as
   well, so the direction of the rotation axis is not unique.
<P>
 
   Given a rotation R and a vector v, normal to the rotation axis n of R,
   the angle between v and R(v), measured counterclockwise around n, is the
   rotation angle of R. We see that the rotation angle depends on the
   direction of the axis: if we pick -n as the axis, we change the sign of
   the angle.
<P>
 
   Note that while the rotation axis and angle of a rotation are not
   uniquely defined, a choice of axis and angle do determine a unique

   An example of a time-dependent coordinate transformation is the

   If R(t) transforms vectors from basis B1 to basis B2, the basis vectors

                         i           j           k
</PRE>
   Since we know the explicit form of the factors (given in the
   ``Notation'' section), we can compute R'(t).
<P>
 
   We must take care when converting velocity vectors between systems whose
   bases are related in a time-dependent way. If R(t) varies extremely
   slowly, it is tempting to ignore the R' term, and in fact this is a
   valid approximation in some cases. However, since the magnitude of this
   term is proportional to the magnitude of p, the term can be large when R
   is quite slowly varying. An example:
<P>
 
   Let B1 be the basis vectors of the J2000 system, and let
<P>
 
<PRE>
   B2  =  { v1(t), v2(t), v3(t) }
</PRE>
   be defined as follows: v1(t) is the geometric Jupiter-Sun vector at
   ephemeris time t, v3(t) is orthogonal to v1(t) and lies in the plane
   containing v1(t) and Jupiter's pole at time t, and v2(t) is the cross
   product of v3(t) and v1(t).
<P>
 
   Let R(t) be the transformation matrix from basis B1 to B2. Then the
   period of R(t) is 1 Jovian year (we're ignoring movement of Jupiter's
   pole). Now if p(t) is the Jupiter-Sun vector in J2000 coordinates, then
   p'(t) is the negative of Jupiter's velocity in J2000 coordinates. But in
   B2 coordinates, R(t) ( p(t) ) always lies along the x-axis, and if we
   approximate Jupiter's motion as a circle, then R(p(t))' is the zero
   vector. So we have the equation
<P>
 
<PRE>
   R(t) p'(t)  +  R'(t) p(t)  =  [ R(t)( p(t) ) ]'  =  0,
</PRE>
   which implies
<P>
 
<PRE>
   R'(t)p(t)   =   - R(t) p'(t).
</PRE>
   So in this case, the term involving R' has the same magnitude as the
   term involving R, even though R is slowly varying.

   The main interest of quaternion multiplication is that we can actually

   Quaternion addition is simple vector addition. Multiplication is a

   One really interesting fact about the product formula is that it is a
   sum of binary operations, each of which is linear (where the
   coefficients are scalars, not quaternions) in both operands. This
   implies that the product formula itself is linear in q1 and q2.
<P>
 
   You can check this: if we scale q1 by x, the product gets scaled by x.
   The same thing happens if we scale q2. If we replace q1 by the sum of
   two quaternions, say
<P>
 
<PRE>
   q1 = q + q' =  ( s + s' )  +  ( v + v' ),
</PRE>
   the product is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   q * q2   +   q' * q2.
</PRE>
   The analogous result occurs when we replace q2 by a sum of two
   quaternions.
<P>
 
   Because of this linearity property, we can define multiplication on a
   small set of quaternions, and then define multiplication on the whole
   set of quaternions by insisting that the multiplication operator is
   linear in both operands. This gives us an equivalent definition of
   multiplication.
<P>
 
   To carry out this definition, we first define multiplication on the four
   quaternions
<P>
 
<PRE>
   1 + ( 0, 0, 0 ), which we call ``1,''
   0 + ( 1, 0, 0 ), which we call ``i,''
   0 + ( 0, 1, 0 ), which we call ``j,''
   0 + ( 0, 0, 1 ), which we call ``k.''
</PRE>
   We treat ``1'' as a scalar and i, j, and k as vectors, and define the
   products
<P>
 
<PRE>
   1 * v   = v,  for v = i, j, k;
 
   v * v   = -1,  for v = i, j, k;
 
   v1 * v2 = - v2 * v1, for v1, v2 = i, j, k;
 
   i * j   = k;
   j * k   = i;
   k * i   = j.
</PRE>
   Multiplication of i, j, and k works just like taking cross products.
<P>
 
   If we now proclaim that multiplication is linear in both operands, then
   since all quaternions can be expressed as linear combinations of ``1,''
   i, j, and k, we've defined multiplication on the entire set of
   quaternions. You can check that this definition of multiplication is
   consistent with our formula above.

<H3> Composing rotations using quaternions
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   There is one last assertion to check: we've said that you can carry out
   composition of rotations using quaternion multiplication. Let's examine
   what that means:
<P>
 
   We've defined a mapping from quaternions to rotations, since the
   relation
<P>
 
<PRE>
   Q = ( cos(w/2),  sin(w/2) n1,  sin(w/2) n2,  sin(w/2) n3 )
</PRE>
   allows us to recover w and the axis ( n1, n2, n3 ), hence the
   corresponding rotation. Now suppose we have two quaternions Q1 and Q2
   that represent rotations R1 and R2, respectively. We're claiming that
   the product Q2 * Q1 represents R2(R1). So, we should be able to recover
   the rotation axis and angle of R2(R1) from the quaternion Q2 * Q1. In
   the ``Mathematical road map' chapter, we will verify this claim.

   The purpose of this chapter is to familiarize you with the mathematical
   ideas essential to dealing with rotations. If you understand the
   relevant mathematics, you are in a position to judge the merits of
   alternative software designs based on CSPICE routines. If you don't
   understand the mathematics, you can still build programs that work by
   paying careful attention to function interface specifications, but the
   design process is more error-prone, and you're unlikely to hit upon
   efficient and elegant solutions.
<P>
 
   The difference between the two perspectives is a bit like the difference
   between having a set of directions to get from point A to point B, and
   having a road map of the entire area.

   This chapter is not organized sequentially, since there is little

<H2> Rotation of a vector about an axis
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Suppose we have a unit vector n, and we wish to rotate a vector r about
   n by an angle of theta radians. What's the resulting vector?
<P>
 
   As in the tutorial discussion of the canonical form for rotations, we
   can express r as the sum of two orthogonal components:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   r  =  rParallel + rPerp.
</PRE>
   Let's give the name rPerp' to the vector obtained by rotating rPerp by
   pi/2 radians about n.
<P>
 
   We know, from the results of the ``canonical form'' section, that
   applying our rotation to r will yield
<P>
 
<PRE>
   rParallel  +  cos(theta) rPerp  +  sin(theta) rPerp'
</PRE>
   So all we have to do is find rPerp and rPerp' in terms of r, n, and
   theta.
<P>
 
   It turns out that rPerp' is precisely n x r, since n x r is parallel to
   rPerp' and has the same magnitude as rPerp, namely
<P>
 
<PRE>
   |r| sin(phi),
</PRE>
   where phi is the angle between r and n. Rotating rPerp' by another pi/2
   radians yields -rPerp, so
<P>
 
<PRE>
   rPerp = -n x ( n x r ).

   Now we're ready to compute the image of r under the rotation. It is:
<P>
 
<PRE>
         rParallel     +   cos(theta) rPerp
                       +   sin(theta) rPerp'
 
   =   ( r - rPerp )   +   cos(theta) rPerp
                       +   sin(theta) rPerp'
 
   =        r          +   ( cos(theta) - 1 )   rPerp
                       +     sin(theta)         rPerp'
 
   =        r          +   ( 1 - cos(theta) )  ( n x ( n x r ) )
                       +      sin(theta)       (     n x r     ).

   This is what we were after: an expression for the image of r under the

   In this section, we derive an expression for a rotation matrix that
   explicitly relates the matrix to the rotation axis and angle. This
   expression is valuable for understanding how to find the rotation axis
   and angle of a rotation matrix, as well as how to build a rotation
   matrix having a given rotation axis and angle. The problem of finding a
   quaternion corresponding to a specified rotation matrix is also solved
   by the expression derived here.
<P>
 
   What's the rotation matrix R that rotates vectors by theta radians about
   the vector n? If n is a unit vector, then the result of the last section
   implies that
<P>
 
<PRE>
   R * r  =  r     +   ( 1 - cos(theta) )  ( n x ( n x r ) )
                   +      sin(theta)       (     n x r     ),
</PRE>
   for any vector r. Now, let
<P>
 
<PRE>
   n = (n1, n2, n3),
</PRE>
   and define the matrix N by
<P>
 
<PRE>
       +-             -+
       |  0   -n3   n2 |
       |               |
   N = |  n3   0   -n1 |;

       | -n2   n1   0  |
       +-             -+
</PRE>
   this definition implies that
<P>
 
<PRE>
   N * r = n x r
</PRE>
   for all r. So we can rewrite the above expression as
<P>
 
<PRE>
   R * r  =  r     +   ( 1 - cos(theta) )  ( N * ( N * r ) )
                   +      sin(theta)       (     N * r     ),

   R * r  =  [  I  +  ( 1 - cos(theta) ) N  +  sin(theta) N  ]  r.
</PRE>
   Since r is arbitrary, we must have

                                      2
   R  =   I   +   ( 1 - cos(theta) ) N   +   sin(theta) N.

   R is the desired matrix.

<H2> Finding the axis and angle of a rotation matrix
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The topic is covered in reference [1], so we'll just make a few notes.
<P>
 
   There are many ways to recover the rotation axis. The most elegant
   method we know of is presented in [1]. The idea is based on the
   observation that any rotation matrix R can be expressed by
<P>
 
<PRE>
                                      2
   R  =   I   +   ( 1 - cos(theta) ) N   +   sin(theta) N,
</PRE>
   where N is derived from the rotation axis, as in the last section. Now N
   is skew-symmetric and N squared is symmetric, so
<P>
 
<PRE>
        T
   R - R   =  2 sin(theta) N.
</PRE>
   As long as sin(theta) is non-zero, we've found N and hence the axis
   itself. If theta is pi, we have
<P>
 
<PRE>
                   2
   R  =   I  +  2 N,
</PRE>
   which still allows us to recover the axis.
<P>
 
   In the tutorial section, we showed that the rotation angle can be
   recovered from the trace of a rotation matrix:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   angle = ACOS (  ( trace - 1 ) / 2  ).
</PRE>
   If the angle is very small, we will determine it more accurately from
   the relation
<P>
 
<PRE>
        T
   R - R   =  2 sin(theta) N.

<H2> Formation of a rotation matrix from a quaternion
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Since the quaternion gives us a rotation's axis and angle, an earlier
   discussion in this chapter gives us one way of recovering the rotation
   matrix: twice the arccosine of the first component of the quaternion
   gives us the rotation angle, and the rest of the quaternion is the
   rotation axis, so AXISAR can be used to form the matrix. In this
   approach, we may want to treat small rotation angles as a special case,
   since the arccosine function is very inaccurate when the argument is
   close to 1. We would use the norm of the ``vector'' portion of the
   quaternion to give us the sine of half the rotation angle instead, and
   recover the rotation angle from this.
<P>
 
   There is a fast, accurate solution available. It depends on the formula
   relating a rotation matrix to its axis and angle, which we derived
   earlier in the chapter. In this approach, we compute the matrix
   corresponding to a quaternion, component by component.
<P>
 
   Define
<P>
 
<PRE>
   c = cos(theta/2),
 
   s = sin(theta/2),
</PRE>
   and let the quaternion

<PRE>
   q  =   c   +  s n
      =   q0  +  s ( q1, q2, q3 )
</PRE>
   represent a rotation R having unit axis vector n and rotation angle
   theta.
<P>
 
   If n = ( n1, n2, n3 ), and we define the matrix N by
<P>
 
<PRE>
       +-             -+
       |  0   -n3   n2 |
       |               |
   N = |  n3   0   -n1 |,
       |               |
       | -n2   n1   0  |
       +-             -+
</PRE>
   then the matrix M representing R is
<P>
 
<PRE>
                                      2
   M  =   I   +   ( 1 - cos(theta) ) N   +   sin(theta) N.
</PRE>
   Now we can make the substitutions
<P>
 
<PRE>
   sin(theta) = 2 c s,
 
                           2

   The idea discussed here is used implicitly throughout the CSPICE
   rotation routines.
<P>
 
   We wish to prove that definitions (1) and (2) from the ``Definition of
   rotations'' section of the tutorial are equivalent. To do this, we need
   to show that a mapping R that satisfies definition (1) also satisfies
   definition (2). This amounts to showing that R has a fixed subspace of
   dimension 1, or equivalently, that R has 1 as one of its eigenvalues.

   We observe that the characteristic polynomial of a rotation is of degree
   three, and so has either zero or two complex roots, hence at least one
   real root. Because rotations preserve norms, the magnitudes of all of
   the roots (eigenvalues), real or complex, are equal to one. So the real
   roots are 1 or -1. The determinant of any rotation matrix is 1, since
   the determinant of any 3 by 3 matrix is the dot product of the third
   column with the cross product of the first and second columns, and for
   rotations, this cross product is the third column. But the determinant
   is also the product of the eigenvalues. In the case where all three
   roots are 1 or -1, we cannot get a product of 1 unless at least one
   eigenvalue is equal to 1. If there are complex roots, they are complex
   conjugates, so their product is 1, which implies that the real root must
   be 1 as well, if the product of all three roots is 1.

<H3> A geometric approach
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Again, we assume that our rotation R satisfies definition (1), and we
   prove that R has a fixed axis.
<P>
 
   We're going to look at the effect of R on the unit sphere, and
   demonstrate that two points on the sphere are fixed. We'll assume that
   the rotation is not the identity and does not map any vector v to -v.
   This last case corresponds to a rotation of pi radians.
<P>
 
   Our first observation is that R maps great circles to great circles.
   This follows from the fact that a great circle is a set of unit vectors,
   all orthogonal to some particular vector v. Since R preserves inner
   products, the image of the great circle is a set of unit vectors, all
   orthogonal to R(v).
<P>
 
   Now, consider the distances that vectors on the unit sphere move when
   the rotation R is applied; there is some vector v, not necessarily
   unique, that moves the maximum distance. Let C1 be a great circle
   passing through v and R(v), and let C2 be a great circle that passes
   through v and intersects C1 at right angles. Now R(C2) passes through
   R(v), and if we can show that it passes through at right angles to C1,
   then C2 and R(C2) intersect at vectors p and -p, both of which are
   normal to v and R(v). So R(p) is either p or -p. But we've assumed that
   R does not map any vector to its inverse, so R(p) = p, and we have a
   fixed vector.
<P>
 
   So, we must show that R(C2) passes through R(v) at right angles to C1.
   If it did not, there would be some point w on C2, close to v, such that
<P>
 
<PRE>
   || R(w) - w ||  &gt;  || R(v) - v ||,
</PRE>
   contradicting our hypothesis that no vector moves farther that v. We
   will leave the rigorous proof of this last assertion to the energetic
   reader.

   In this section, we verify some claims made in the tutorial on

<P>
 
   There are two assertions that we need to prove:

<UL>

<A NAME="Assertion 1"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Assertion 1
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   To prove the first assertion, we express R(v) in the form
<P>
 
<PRE>
   R(v) =  v + sin(theta) n x v  + ( 1 - cos(theta) ) n x ( n x v ),
</PRE>
   where n is a unit axis vector and theta is the corresponding rotation
   angle. We also define the constants C and S by
<P>
 
<PRE>
   C = cos(theta/2),
   S = sin(theta/2).
</PRE>
   The quaternion
<P>
 
<PRE>
   q = C  +  S n

   represents R. To check the assertion, we compute
<P>
 
<PRE>
        ( C  +  S n ) * v * ( C  -  S n )
 
 
   =    ( C  +  S n ) * [ ( S  &lt;v,n&gt; )  +  ( C v  -  S v x n ) ]
 
                                           2

     +  [ C v  - C S v x n  +  S &lt;v, n&gt; n  +  S C n x v
 
         2
     -  S n x ( v x n ) ].
</PRE>
   Since n is normal to v x n, the scalar part of the last line is zero,
   which leaves us with

    2       2                              2
   C v  +  S &lt;v, n&gt; n  +  2 S C n x v  -  S n x ( v x n ).
</PRE>
   We can re-write this again as
<P>

    2       2                               2
   C v  +  S &lt;v, n&gt; n  +  2 S C n x v  + 2 S n x ( n x v )

                                       -   S n x ( n x v ),

   and using the vector identity
<P>
 
<PRE>
   A x ( B x C ) =  &lt; A, C &gt; B  -  &lt; A, B &gt; C,
</PRE>
   we can modify the final term to arrive at
<P>
 
<PRE>
    2       2                               2
   C v  +  S &lt;v, n&gt; n  +  2 S C n x v  + 2 S n x ( n x v )

</PRE>
   Since n is a unit vector, the entire expression reduces to

                                 2

                   2
           +  2 sin (theta/2) n x ( n x v)

<A NAME="Assertion 2"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Assertion 2
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The second assertion follows rather more quickly from the first. Given
   that R1(v) is
<P>
 
<PRE>
              *
   q1 * v * q1 ,
</PRE>
   we can express R2(R1(v)) by

                        *      *
      q2 * ( q1 * v * q1 ) * q2
                                   *
   =  ( q2 * q1 ) * v * ( q2 * q1 ).
</PRE>
   Now let q be a quaternion that represents R2(R1); then
<P>
 
<PRE>
            *
   q * v * q   =  R2(R1(v))
</PRE>
   for all v. We'll be done if we can show that, in general, for unit
   quaternions x and y, if
<P>
 
<PRE>
            *             *
   x * v * x  =  y * v * y
</PRE>
   for all vectors v, then x equals y or -y. But this equation implies that
<P>
 
<PRE>
    *                 *
   y * x * v  =  v * y * x,
</PRE>
   for all v, which in turn implies that
<P>
 
<PRE>
    *
   y * x
</PRE>
   is a scalar, since only scalar quaternions commute with every vector
   quaternion (due to the cross product term in the product formula). Since
   y and x are unit quaternions, either
<P>
 
<PRE>
    *
   y * x = 1
</PRE>
   or
<P>
 
<PRE>
    *
   y * x = -1,
</PRE>
   so x = y or -y.
<P>
 
   We conclude that q2 * q1 = q or -q, so q2 * q1 does represent R2(R1).

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Recovery of Euler angles from a rotation matrix
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Here's the problem: Given a rotation matrix M, and a set of coordinate
   axes indexed by i1, i2, i3, find angles w1, w2, w3 such that
<P>
 
<PRE>
   M = [w1]     [w2]      [w3]  .                       (1)
           i1       i2        i3
</PRE>
   There are a couple of reasons why we might want to solve this problem:
   first, the representation of a rotation by three Euler angles is a
   common one, so it is convenient to be able to convert the matrix
   representation to this form. Also, the three angles on the right hand
   side of equation (1) often allow you to visualize a rotation more
   readily than does the matrix representation M.
<P>
 
   This ``factorization'' is possible if i2 does not equal i1 or i3. For
   each valid sequence (i1-i2-i3) of axes, there is a set of functions that
   give us w1, w2, and w3 as a function of M:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   w1 = f1         ( M ),
          i1-i2-i3
 
   w2 = f2         ( M ),
          i1-i2-i3
 
   w3 = f3         ( M ).
          i1-i2-i3
</PRE>
   How can we derive the functions
<P>
 
<PRE>
   f1        ,  f2        ,  f3        ?
     i1-i2-i3     i1-i2-i3     i1-i2-i3
</PRE>
   One approach is to multiply the matrices on the right hand side of
   equation (1); this yields a matrix whose entries are sums of products of
   sines and cosines of w1, w2, and w3. We can then equate the entries of
   this matrix to those of M, and find formulas for w1, w2, and w3 that
   arise from the component-wise correspondence. In subsequent sections, we
   actually carry out this procedure for 3-1-3 and 1-2-3 factorizations.
<P>
 
   There are twelve sets of axes to consider, so there are potentially
   twelve sets of functions to compute. However, the procedure we've just
   described is not enjoyable enough to justify doing it twelve times. We'd
   like to find a slicker way of solving the problem. One approach is to
   find a way of ``recycling'' the formulas we derived for one particular
   axis sequence. Here's an example of how we might do this:
<P>
 
   Suppose that we already have functions
<P>
 
<PRE>
   f1     ,  f2     ,  f3
     3-1-3     3-1-3     3-1-3
</PRE>
   that allow us to factor rotation matrix M as a 3-1-3 product:
<P>
 
   If
<P>
 
<PRE>
   M = [w1]   [w2]    [w3] .                            (2)
           3      1       3
</PRE>
   then
<P>
 
<PRE>
   w1 = f1      ( M ),
          3-1-3
 
   w2 = f2      ( M ),
          3-1-3
 
   w3 = f3      ( M ).
          3-1-3
</PRE>
   We'd like to somehow use the functions we've already got to factor M as
   a 2-3-2 product: we want to find functions
<P>
 
<PRE>
   f1     ,   f2     ,   f3
     2-3-2      2-3-2      2-3-2
</PRE>
   such that
<P>
 
<PRE>
   M = [y1]   [y2]   [y3] ,                             (3)
           2      3      2
</PRE>
   and
<P>
 
<PRE>
   y1 = f1      ( M ),
          2-3-2
 
   y2 = f2      ( M ),
          2-3-2
 
   y3 = f3      ( M )
          2-3-2
</PRE>
   without having to derive
<P>
 
<PRE>
   f1     ,   f2     ,   f3
     2-3-2      2-3-2      2-3-2
</PRE>
   from scratch.
<P>
 
   We'll start out by using a new basis, relative to which the right hand
   side of (3) is not a 2-3-2, but rather a 3-1-3 rotation. It is important
   to note here that bases are ordered sets of vectors; changing the order
   changes the basis.
<P>
 
   Let the basis B1 be the ordered set of vectors
<P>
 
<PRE>
   {e(1), e(2), e(3)},
</PRE>
   and let the basis B2 be the ordered set of vectors
<P>
 
<PRE>
   {e(3), e(1), e(2)}.
</PRE>
   Now the rotation matrix
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [y]
      2
</PRE>
   expressed relative to B1 represents the same rotation as the matrix
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [y]
      3
</PRE>
   expressed relative to B2. Both matrices represent a rotation of y
   radians about the vector e(2). Similarly, the matrix
<P>
 
<PRE>
   M  =  [y1]  [y2]  [y3]
             2     3     2
</PRE>
   expressed relative to B1 represents the same rotation as the matrix
<P>
 
<PRE>
   M' =  [y1]  [y2]  [y3]
             3     1     3
</PRE>
   expressed relative to B2. So if C is the matrix whose columns are the
   elements of B2, expressed relative to B1, namely
<P>
 
<PRE>
        +-       -+
        | 0  1  0 |
   C =  | 0  0  1 |,
        | 1  0  0 |
        +-       -+
</PRE>
   then
<P>
 
<PRE>
    -1
   C   M  C   =  M'                                     (4)
</PRE>
   We can use the functions
<P>
 
<PRE>
   f1     ,  f2     ,  f3
     3-1-3     3-1-3     3-1-3
</PRE>
   to factor M' as a 3-1-3 product: applying (4), we have
<P>
 
<PRE>
              -1
   y1 = f1 ( C   M  C ),                                (5)
 
              -1
   y2 = f2 ( C   M  C ),                                (6)
 
              -1
   y3 = f3 ( C   M  C ),                                (7)
</PRE>
   so we've found functions that yield the angles y1, y2 and y3 that we
   sought. ``No muss, no fuss.''
<P>
 
   How much mileage can we get out of our 3-1-3 factorization functions?
   Looking at our example, we see that the main ``trick'' is to find a
   basis so that the factorization we want is a 3-1-3 factorization with
   respect to that basis. It is important the new basis be right-handed;
   otherwise the form of the matrices
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [w]
      i
</PRE>
   is not preserved. It turns out that for any axis sequence of the form
   a-b-a, we can find a right-handed basis such that the factorization we
   want is a 3-1-3 factorization with respect to that basis. There are two
   cases: if we define a successor function s on the integers 1, 2, 3 such
   that
<P>
 
<PRE>
   s(1) = 2,
   s(2) = 3,
   s(3) = 1,
</PRE>
   we either have b = s(a) or a = s(b).
<P>
 
   In the first case, b = s(a), and if our original ordered basis is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   B1 = { e(1), e(2), e(3) },
</PRE>
   then
<P>
 
<PRE>
   B2 = { e(b), e( s(b) ), e(a) }
</PRE>
   is the right-handed basis we're looking for. You can check that
<P>
 
<PRE>
   e(a) = e(b) x e( s(b) ).
</PRE>
   We recall that the transformation matrix C we require has the elements
   of B2 as columns.
<P>
 
   For example, if a is 2 and b is 3, then B2 is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   { e(3), e(1), e(2) },
</PRE>
   and the matrix C is
<P>
 
<PRE>
        +-       -+
        | 0  1  0 |
   C =  | 0  0  1 |,
        | 1  0  0 |
        +-       -+
</PRE>
   as we have seen previously.
<P>
 
   The axis sequences that can be handled by the above procedure are 1-2-1,
   2-3-2, and 3-1-3.
<P>
 
   In the second case, a = s(b), and if our original ordered basis is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   B1 = { e(1), e(2), e(3) },
</PRE>
   then
<P>
 
<PRE>
   B2 = { e(b), -e( s(a) ), e(a) }
</PRE>
   is the right-handed basis we're looking for. Again, you can verify this
   by taking cross products. The transformation matrix C we require has the
   elements of B2 as columns.
<P>
 
   For example, if a = 2 and b = 1, then B2 is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   { e(1), -e(3), e(2)) }
</PRE>
   and the matrix C is
<P>
 
<PRE>
        +-       -+
        | 1  0  0 |
   C =  | 0  0  1 |.
        | 0 -1  0 |
        +-       -+
</PRE>
   The axis sequences that can be handled by the above procedure are 1-3-1,
   2-1-2, and 3-2-3. So we can use our 3-1-3 formula to handle all of the
   a-b-a factorizations, just by computing the correct transformation
   matrix C.
<P>
 
   What about a-b-c factorizations? As you might guess, the procedure we've
   described also applies to these, with very little modification.
<P>
 
   Suppose we have the formulas we need to carry out a 1-2-3 factorization.
   We'd like to find a basis that allows us to represent the a-b-c product
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [w1]   [w2]   [w3]
       a      b      c
</PRE>
   as the product
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [w1]   [w2]   [w3] .
       1      2      3
</PRE>
   Again, there are two cases, depending on whether b is the successor of a
   or a is the successor of b, according to our cyclic ordering.
<P>
 
   In the case where b is the successor of a, the right-handed basis we
   want is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   B2 = { e(a), e(b), e(c) }.
</PRE>
   With respect to the basis B2, our a-b-c factorization is a 1-2-3
   factorization. Again, we can form the transformation matrix C by letting
   its columns be the elements of B2.
<P>
 
   In the second case, a is the successor of b. Our new basis is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   B2 = { e(a), e(b), -e(c)}.
</PRE>
   In this case, there is a slight twist: the change of basis we use
   negates the third rotation angle. This is not a serious problem; the
   change of basis converts the product
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [w1]   [w2]   [w3]
       a      b      c
</PRE>
   to

   so we can still recover the angles w1, w2, and w3 easily. So our 1-2-3
   factorization formula allows us to handle all the a-b-c factorizations.
<P>
 
   Having shown that we can perform all of the a-b-a and a-b-c
   factorizations using just one formula for each type of factorization, we
   now proceed to derive those formulas. This is not a particularly
   instructive procedure, but the derivations ought to be written down
   somewhere, and this is as good a place as any.

   At this point, we can recover w1, w2, and w3 from the elements of M. The
   inverse trigonometric functions used below are borrowed from Fortran. We
   find w2 from the relation
<P>
 
<PRE>
   w2 = ACOS( M(3,3) ).
</PRE>
   (So w2 is in [0, pi].)
<P>
 
   If w2 is not equal to 0 or pi, then we can recover w1 as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   M(1,3)       sin(w1)sin(w2)
   ------   =   --------------  =  tan(w1),
   M(2,3)       cos(w1)sin(w2)
 
   w1 = ATAN2 ( M(1,3), M(2,3) ).
</PRE>
   We find w3 in an analogous fashion, again assuming w2 is not equal to 0
   or pi. We find
<P>
 
<PRE>
    M(3,1)       sin(w2)sin(w3)
   -------   =   --------------  =  tan(w3),
   -M(3,2)       sin(w2)cos(w3)
 
   w3 = ATAN2 ( M(3,1), -M(3,2) ).
</PRE>
   Note the minus sign used in the second ATAN2 argument. For ATAN2 to
   determine the correct value, it is necessary that the first and second
   arguments have the same signs as sin(w3) and cos(w3), respectively.
<P>
 
   Now if w2 is equal to zero or pi, we have a degenerate case: M is the
   product of two rotations about the third coordinate axis. The angles of
   the rotations are not determined uniquely, only the sum of the angles
   is. One way of finding a factorization is to set w3 to zero, and solve
   for w1. The matrix M then is equal to
