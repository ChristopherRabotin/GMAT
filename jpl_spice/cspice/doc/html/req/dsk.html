<H2> Introduction
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The Digital Shape Kernel (DSK) subsystem is the component of SPICE
   concerned with detailed shape models for extended objects. These objects
   typically are solar system bodies such as planets, dwarf planets,
   natural satellites, asteroids, and comet nuclei. DSK data can represent
   the shapes of such objects, as well as local topography, such as that in
   the vicinity of a rover or a tracking station.
<P>
 
   DSK data also can represent shapes of artificial objects such as
   spacecraft components, or represent abstractions such as the subset of a
   target body's surface that has a property of interest.
<P>
 
   The DSK subsystem comprises software, the DSK file format specification,
   and documentation.
<P>
 
   The primary purpose of the DSK subsystem is to enable SPICE-based
   applications to conveniently and efficiently use detailed shape data in
   geometry computations performed by SPICE functions. DSK data enable
   these functions to produce more accurate results than those obtainable
   using triaxial ellipsoid shape models. See the section below titled
   ``High-Level DSK-Enabled Geometry Routines'' for details.
<P>
 
   The DSK implementation ensures that shape data used by SPICE are
   accompanied by all of the attribute information necessary for correct,
   programmatic use of the data---including, but not limited to, reference
   frames, central bodies, coordinate systems, spatial coverage bounds, and
   time bounds of applicability. The DSK format enables data to be
   augmented by indexes, or other pre-computed parameters, that greatly
   enhance the speed of common geometric computations, such as those of
   ray-surface intercepts.
<P>
 
   DSK data sets can be distributed across multiple DSK files; this is
   normal for large data sets. Such sets of files can be ``loaded'' (made
   available for read access by CSPICE software) concurrently; CSPICE
   software will select data from the appropriate files as needed to
   perform computations.
<P>
 
   The DSK file format facilitates storage, transmission, and archival of
   shape data. It allows the data to be annotated with free-form
   descriptive comments, also called ``metadata.''
<P>
 
   DSK documentation uses the term ``data type'' to refer to types of
   mathematical shape representations, associated DSK file formats, and
   software. The DSK subsystem is designed to accommodate multiple data
   types, and to enable high-level SPICE geometry software to function
   independently of these types.
<P>
 
   Currently there is only one DSK data type, which represents the shape of
   an object by a set of triangular plates. This representation is called a
   ``tessellated plate model'' or ``triangular plate model.'' The DSK
   documentation refers to this type as ``DSK type 2.''
<P>
 
   Support for digital elevation models (DEMs) will be added in a later
   version of the SPICE Toolkit; one or more new DSK data types will be
   developed to support such data.
<P>
 
   Because many popular file formats for shape data exist, and because it
   is impractical for these formats to be used directly by SPICE for
   geometric computations, the DSK subsystem supports conversion of a
   variety of text-based shape data file formats to DSK format; it also
   supports conversion of DSK files to a variety of text formats.

   Below we list the CSPICE functions that either work directly with DSK
   files or that support DSK usage. We also briefly describe the CSPICE
   utility programs that work with DSK files.

<H2> High-Level DSK-Enabled Geometry Functions
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   High-level SPICE geometry functions constitute the principal application
   programming interface to the DSK subsystem. The functions described here
   are supported in all language versions of the SPICE Toolkit.
<P>
 
   All of these routines perform computations that involve a target body.
   All can model the shape of that body using data provided by DSK files.
   Many of the functions can use triaxial ellipsoid models as well.
<P>
 
   These functions have extensive header documentation. Each header
   describes all input and output arguments and includes one or more
   example programs accompanied by example meta-kernels and corresponding
   program outputs.

   The terms ``shape data,'' ``surface data,'' and ``topography'' are
   generally used as synonyms in DSK documentation. The term ``surface,''
   when applied to DSK data, refers solely to the geometric form of the
   surface---never to associated properties such as albedo or chemical
   composition.
<P>
 
   The term ``surfaces'' is also used to refer to DSK data sets themselves,
   particularly when there are multiple data sets, differing in some
   aspects, that provide data for a given body. For example, Mars
   topography data sets based on MGS MOLA data might be referred to as the
   ``64 pixels/degree surface'' or the ``128 pixels/degree surface.''
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Surface IDs"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Surface IDs
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   To facilitate run-time selection of DSK data, SPICE provides DSK
   segments with a second identifying attribute in addition to the
   ``central body'': the ``surface ID code'' (or ``surface ID''). Different
   DSK data sets for a given body may be assigned distinct surface IDs.
<P>
 
   At run time, calls from user applications to CSPICE functions can
   restrict the DSK data used to those from specified surfaces. For
   example, a user application might direct the CSPICE sub-observer point
   function <a href="../cspice/subpnt_c.html">subpnt_c</a> to to use a high-resolution surface for a spacecraft
   altitude computation, versus a low-resolution surface for plotting the
   spacecraft's ground track.
<P>
 
   Because surface IDs enable SPICE applications to select data from among
   those available in loaded DSK files, it is not necessary for
   applications to repeatedly load and unload DSK files to control which
   shape data are used for a given body and computation. Applications
   normally can load at start-up all of the DSK data for a given body, then
   select the data to be used on a per-computation basis.
<P>
 
   Avoiding repetitive DSK loading tends to improve an application's
   computation speed. This is because after any change to the set of loaded
   DSK files, the DSK subsystem must perform some bookkeeping computations
   before DSK-based computations can be performed. Degradation of overall
   execution speed due to these computations is slight as long as they're
   performed infrequently.
<P>
 
   SPICE surface IDs are associated with surface names; these associations
   are made via assignments in SPICE text kernels. Surface name-ID
   associations are made for specific bodies: the combination of a body
   name or body ID and surface name can be mapped to a surface ID code, and
   the combination of a body name or body ID and a surface ID code can be
   mapped to a surface name.
<P>
 
   A given surface ID code can be re-used for different bodies without
   ambiguity. For a given body, it's important for users to coordinate
   assignment of surface names and surface IDs.
<P>
 
   For a given body, the surface name to surface ID mapping may be
   many-to-one. If multiple surface names are associated with a surface ID
   for a specified body, then the surface ID-to-name conversion routines
   will map that surface ID to the last name associated with the ID. The
   surface name-to-ID mapping routines will map any of the surface names to
   that surface ID.
<P>
 
   The CSPICE functions for converting between surface IDs and surface
   names are listed in the section ``Surface Name and ID Conversion
   Functions'' above.

<A NAME="Defining Surface Name-ID Mappings"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Defining Surface Name-ID Mappings
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Surface name-to-ID mappings may be defined at run time by loading text
   kernels containing kernel variable assignments of the form
<P>
 
<PRE>
   NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += ( &lt;surface name 1&gt;, ... )
   NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += ( &lt;surface code 1&gt;, ... )
   NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += ( &lt;body code 1&gt;,    ... )
</PRE>
   Above, the Ith elements of the lists on the assignments' right hand
   sides together define the Ith surface name/ID mapping.
<P>
 
   The same effect can be achieved using assignments formatted as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += &lt;surface name 1&gt;
   NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += &lt;surface code 1&gt;
   NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += &lt;body code 1&gt;
 
   NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += &lt;surface name 2&gt;
   NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += &lt;surface code 2&gt;
   NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += &lt;body code 2&gt;
 
      ...
</PRE>
   Note the use of the
<P>
 
<PRE>
   +=
</PRE>
   operator; this operator appends to rather than overwrites the kernel
   variable named on the left hand side of the assignment.
<P>
 
   Multiple surface names, also called ``surface aliases,'' can be mapped
   to a surface ID for a given body as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += &lt;surface name 1&gt;
   NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += &lt;surface code 1&gt;
   NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += &lt;body code 1&gt;
 
   NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += &lt;surface name 2&gt;
   NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += &lt;surface code 1&gt;
   NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += &lt;body code 1&gt;
</PRE>
   Using this mapping, body code 1 and either surface name will be mapped
   by the surface name-to-ID conversion routines to surface code 1. Body
   code 1 and surface code 1 will be mapped by the surface ID-to-name
   routines to surface name 2.

<H2> Segments
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Data in every DSK file are grouped into one or more subsets called
   ``segments.'' DSK segments are implemented as DLA segments, also called
   ``arrays.'' Each DSK segment has double precision and integer
   components.
<P>
 
   Each DSK segment contains data for some or all of the surface of a
   single body object. This object is called the ``body,'' ``central
   body,'' or ``center,'' even though it need not be a natural solar system
   body.
<P>
 
   Within a segment, the data have the following attributes in common:

   These attributes are discussed in the following sections.
<P>
 
   When DSK files are loaded via one or more calls to <a href="../cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>, all
   segments from those files become available to the DSK subsystem for use
   in computations. At run time, when a request for shape data for a
   specified body is made to the DSK subsystem, all segments for that body
   can be considered as possible sources of data to satisfy the request.
<P>
 
   For small DSK data sets, such as low-resolution shape models for
   asteroids, a single segment can suffice to store all of the data for the
   model. Large DSK data sets typically consist of tens or hundreds of
   segments distributed over multiple DSK files. Normally all segments for
   a given body can be loaded at one time. The limit on the total number of
   DSK segments for all bodies that can be loaded is given in Appendix B.

<A NAME="DLA and DSK Descriptors"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> DLA and DSK Descriptors
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Lower-level CSPICE DSK functions refer to DSK segments by means of data
   structures called DLA and DSK ``descriptors.''
<P>
 
   The DLA descriptor of a DSK segment indicates the location of the
   segment's data in the DSK file containing that segment. DLA descriptors
   contain DAS base addresses and sizes of the double precision and integer
   components of the associated segments. DLA descriptors are integer
   arrays.
<P>
 
   User applications can locate all segments in a DSK file by calling the
   DLA ``begin forward search'' routine <a href="../cspice/dlabfs_c.html">dlabfs_c</a>, then repeatedly calling
   the DLA ``find next segment'' routine <a href="../cspice/dlafns_c.html">dlafns_c</a>. See the API
   documentation of those functions for details and code examples.
<P>
 
   The DSK descriptor of a DSK segment contains the segment's attribute
   information; these are the attributes listed above. User applications
   can determine attributes of a DSK segment by obtaining the DLA
   descriptor of the segment, then calling the CSPICE function <a href="../cspice/dskgd_c.html">dskgd_c</a> to
   obtain the segment's DSK descriptor.
<P>
 
   See the chapter ``DSK Files'' for details.

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Reference Frames"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Reference Frames
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Each DSK segment has an associated reference frame. That frame is fixed
   to the central body. The center of the frame need not be the central
   body. For example, a segment containing data for Mars could use a
   topocentric reference frame centered at a specified surface point on
   Mars.
<P>
 
   Within a DSK segment, all shape data are expressed relative to that
   segment's reference frame.
<P>
 
   For example, if a segment containing data for Phobos uses the IAU_PHOBOS
   body-fixed frame, and if the segment contains vertices of triangular
   plates, the coordinates of those vertices are expressed in the
   IAU_PHOBOS reference frame.
<P>
 
   The set of DSK segments to be used in a computation for a given body
   need not be associated with a single reference frame, but using data
   from mixed frames should be done cautiously. It is up to the user to
   combine data in ways that make sense.
<P>
 
   For example, Mars data expressed in the Mars-centered IAU_MARS frame can
   be used together with Mars data expressed in one or more Mars
   topocentric frames.
<P>
 
   On the other hand, it doesn't make sense to combine earth data expressed
   in the ITRF93 frame with data expressed in the IAU_EARTH frame, because
   those frames have some relative rotation. The same is true for data
   expressed in the IAU_MOON and MOON_ME frames: even though these are
   realizations of the same reference frame, the approximation error in the
   IAU_MOON frame is time-dependent, so these frames have relative
   rotation.

<A NAME="Coordinate Systems and Spatial Coverage"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Coordinate Systems and Spatial Coverage
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   For the purpose of segment selection, the spatial coverage of a DSK
   segment is considered to be three-dimensional: it is a region of space
   within which the segment provides data for the associated body.
<P>
 
   The supported coordinate systems are:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Latitudinal (planetocentric)
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Planetodetic
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Rectangular
<BR><BR></UL>
   Planetocentric coordinates are appropriate for most natural bodies.
<P>
 
   Planetodetic coordinates should be used only for large bodies having
   surfaces well approximated by spheroids.
<P>
 
   Rectangular coordinates may be appropriate for data sets expressed in
   topocentric reference frames, for artificial structures, and for
   extremely irregular natural bodies.
<P>
 
   A segment's coordinate system is used to represent the segment's
   coverage bounds.
<P>
 
   For example, a DSK segment that uses the Phobos planetocentric
   coordinate system and IAU_PHOBOS reference frame might contain surface
   data for Phobos within the spatial region
<P>
 
<PRE>
   Planetocentric latitude:    -90 to  +90 degrees
   Planetocentric longitude:  -180 to +180 degrees
   Radius:                       0 to   10 km
</PRE>
   Here the planetocentric coordinate system's equatorial plane is the X-Y
   plane of the IAU_PHOBOS frame. The prime meridian of the coordinate
   system lies in the frame's X-Z plane and intersects the +X axis of the
   frame.
<P>
 
   Another example: a DSK segment that uses a Mars planetodetic coordinate
   system might contain surface data for Mars within the spatial region
<P>
 
<PRE>
   Planetodetic latitude:   -30 to +30 degrees
   Planetodetic longitude:  +60 to +90 degrees
   Altitude:                -10 to +20 km
</PRE>
   Here the planetodetic coordinate system's equatorial plane is the X-Y
   plane of the segment's reference frame, for example the IAU_MARS frame.
   The prime meridian of the coordinate system lies in the frame's X-Z
   plane and intersects the +X axis of the frame. The altitude is measured
   relative to a reference spheroid, the size and shape parameters of which
   are contained in the segment.
<P>
 
   A third example: a DSK segment that contains data for a horizon mask for
   a tracking station might use rectangular coordinates and a topocentric
   frame having axis directions
<P>
 
<PRE>
   X: north
   Y: west
   Z: up
</PRE>
   The region covered by the segment might be
<P>
 
<PRE>
   X:   -0.5 to +0.5 km
   Y:   -0.5 to +0.5 km
   Z:   -0.2 to +0.2 km
</PRE>
   In this case the horizon mask need not model the topography surrounding
   the station; it can simply model obscuration due to the topography. So
   the coverage region need not extend to the horizon; it can be contained
   in a small box enclosing the station.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Spatial coverage: Dimensions"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Spatial coverage: Dimensions
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The coverage bounds of a segment enable the DSK subsystem to rapidly
   determine whether the segment may be applicable for a given geometric
   computation such as a ray-surface intercept. For this purpose, it is
   convenient to consider the coverage of a segment to be
   three-dimensional.
<P>
 
   For many applications, it is more natural to consider the spatial
   coverage of a segment to be two-dimensional. This is true when the
   surface represented by the segment can be expressed as a function that
   maps a two-dimensional region to radius or height values. For example,
   surface height relative to a reference spheroid can be a function of
   planetodetic longitude and latitude. In a topocentric frame, the Z
   coordinate of a surface can be a function of the X and Y coordinates.
<P>
 
   In cases where a surface is viewed as a function of two coordinates,
   those coordinates are called the ``domain coordinates.'' In some DSK
   documentation, the terms ``horizontal'' or ``tangential'' coordinates
   may be used as synonyms.
<P>
 
   The DSKBRIEF summary utility displays spatial coverage in three
   dimensions for individual segments. It treats spatial coverage as
   two-dimensional for the purpose of displaying combined coverage of
   multiple segments, and for displaying gaps within that combined
   coverage. For such displays, coverage and gaps will be displayed as
   longitude-latitude rectangles in the planetocentric or planetodetic
   systems, or as X-Y rectangles in the rectangular system.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Spatial coverage: Gaps and Padding"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Spatial coverage: Gaps and Padding
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   In general, the spatial bounds of a DSK segment don't imply that there
   is complete coverage of the domain coordinates within those bounds;
   spatial coverage can have gaps. In some cases this is an inevitable
   consequence of the shape of the body: for example, if the coordinate
   system is rectangular and the body is a torus lying on the X-Y plane,
   there will be no data for some (X,Y) coordinates.
<P>
 
   Spatial coverage gaps also can occur due to the way data are grouped in
   segments by a DSK file's creator. Normally DSK file creators should
   ensure that segments don't have coverage gaps that users would not
   expect. Coverage gaps can cause geometric computations to fail at run
   time.
<P>
 
   The concept of spatial coverage gaps normally applies to a segment's
   domain coordinates, such as longitude and latitude. It is also possible
   for a surface's maximum or minimum height, radius, or Z coordinate to
   be, respectively, strictly less than or strictly greater than the
   corresponding upper or lower bound. The term ``gap'' usually does not
   apply to such differences; these differences usually have no impact on
   computations.
<P>
 
   Data for a segment need not be confined to the spatial region delimited
   by the spatial bounds. DSK creators can include in DSK segments
   ``padding'' data that extend slightly beyond the segments' spatial
   bounds. Padding data can ensure that coverage implied by a segment's
   domain coordinate bounds is really present.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Time Bounds"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Time Bounds
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Segments in a DSK file provide data for a time interval determined by
   the DSK file's creator.
<P>
 
   For a surface having a shape that evolves over a time span of interest,
   multiple versions of the surface corresponding to different time
   intervals can be created. When a computation is performed for a
   particular time, only segments providing data for time intervals that
   include that time will be considered.
<P>
 
   In many cases the surface represented by a DSK segment is considered to
   be constant with respect to time, so the start and stop time bounds may
   be set, respectively, to values far in the past and future (for example,
   plus or minus one century) relative to the time range for which the
   segment is expected to be used.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Data Types"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Data Types
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The DSK subsystem supports multiple forms of mathematical
   representations of shape data. For each such form, there is a
   corresponding DSK segment type and set of functions that can access
   segments of that type. Collectively the form of representation, the
   segment structure and associated software are called a ``DSK data
   type.''
<P>
 
   DSK data type 2 represents body shapes using collections of triangular
   plates. Another DSK data type, not yet implemented, will represent
   surfaces as digital elevation models (DEMs).
<P>
 
   The CSPICE system's high-level geometry functions operate without
   reference to the data types of DSK segments providing shape data to
   these routines. These routines require lower-level, type-dependent
   routines to provide functionality that is common across all DSK data
   types, such as ``find the intercept of a ray with the surface defined by
   a segment,'' or ``return the unit length outward normal vector at a
   specified point on the surface defined by a segment.''
<P>
 
   Some CSPICE functions perform functions specific to particular data
   types. For example, the functions <a href="../cspice/dskv02_c.html">dskv02_c</a> and <a href="../cspice/dskp02_c.html">dskp02_c</a> return,
   respectively, vertices and plates from a type 2 segment.

<H2> Data Competition and Priority
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Two segments containing data for the same body, surface, location, and
   time are said to contain ``competing'' data. Segment priority is a
   scheme for determining which segment's data to use in case of
   competition.
<P>
 
   Unlike the other SPICE binary kernel systems, the DSK subsystem does not
   necessarily make use of segment priority for a given computation.
   Instead, a user application can specify that a computation is
   ``unprioritized.'' This means that all loaded data for the given body
   and a specified list of surfaces are to be used together to represent
   the shape to be used in the computation.
<P>
 
   When DSK data for different surfaces for one body are loaded
   concurrently, surface lists, which are inputs to CSPICE API functions
   that use DSK data, can be used to ensure that the correct set of DSK
   data are used for a given computation, and that none of the data
   compete. It is not necessary to load or unload DSK files to give the
   desired data top priority.
<P>
 
   See the API documentation for any high-level CSPICE geometry function,
   for example <a href="../cspice/sincpt_c.html">sincpt_c</a>, for a discussion of surface lists.
<P>
 
   In the N0066 CSPICE Toolkit, all high-level geometry functions that work
   with DSK data support only unprioritized computations.
<P>
 
   Although not currently used, the DSK subsystem does have a priority
   scheme: as in the SPICE SPK, CK, and binary PCK subsystems, when two
   segments from the same file compete, the one located later in the file
   (at higher addresses) takes precedence. When two segments from different
   files compete, the one from the file loaded later takes precedence.

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Greedy Algorithms"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Greedy Algorithms
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   A numerical problem affecting DSK computations is the possibility of
   ``false negatives'': finding no result when one should be expected. An
   example of this is not finding a ray-surface intercept when one clearly
   should exist.
<P>
 
   The possibility of false negatives, at a minimum, complicates the design
   of user applications that depend on DSK data.
<P>
 
   Aside from errors in DSK files themselves, the main cause of false
   negative results is round-off error.
<P>
 
   Round-off error can cause a ray that should hit the common edge between
   two plates to be determined, according to double precision arithmetic,
   to miss both plates. Similarly, round-off error can cause a ray that
   should hit the common longitude boundary or latitude boundary shared by
   two DSK segments to hit neither segment boundary.
<P>
 
   The DSK subsystem uses several techniques to avoid false negative
   results for ray-surface intercepts. These fall into the category of
   ``greedy algorithms'': they effectively treat segments and data as
   though they occupy not only the spatial regions implied by their
   boundaries, but the surrounding regions as well. (An examination of the
   default DSK ``greedy'' parameters will reveal that the greediness of DSK
   algorithms is a mild case. See ``Access to DSK Tolerances and Margin
   Values'' below.)
<P>
 
   For example, when a ray-surface intercept computation is attempted, an
   intercept is considered to exist if the ray passes sufficiently close to
   the target---not only if it hits.

<H3> Greedy Ray-Segment Boundary Intercepts

   In the discussion below, we refer to both ``segment boundaries'' and
   ``tangent surfaces.'' Both terms require definition:
<P>
 
<DL><DT>
<B>
 Segment boundary
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 This is the set of surfaces forming the boundary of the spatial region
defined by the coordinate bounds in a segment's DSK descriptor. There
are six such surfaces: for each one, one coordinate is at the segment's
minimum or maximum value for that coordinate, and the other coordinates
vary from their minimum to their maximum.<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 For example, a segment using planetocentric latitudinal coordinates
might have the longitude range 0:30 degrees, latitude range 0:45
degrees, and radius range 6300:6400 km. Then the segment's boundary on
the sphere of radius 6400 km has longitude ranging from 0 to 30
degrees, and latitude ranging from 0 to 45 degrees.<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 Tangent surface
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 This a ``level surface'' in geometric terms: a surface defined by
setting one coordinate to a segment's minimum or maximum bound for that
coordinate. For the segment above, the sphere of radius 6400 km is one
such tangent surface. As in this example, the tangent surfaces may
include areas that are not part of the segment's boundary.<BR>
</DL>
   One step in the ray-surface intercept computation is determination of
   the set of applicable segments that are hit by the ray. The segments
   that have the appropriate attributes are tested to see whether the ray
   hits the tangent surfaces defined by the coordinate ranges in the
   segments' DSK descriptors.
<P>
 
   By default, when the ray's intersection with a segment's tangent surface
   is computed, if that intersection is close to the spatial region
   indicated by the segment's boundaries, an intersection with the segment
   is considered to exist. In the example we're using, a ray's intersection
   with the sphere of radius 6400 km that has longitude slightly greater
   than 30 degrees and latitude slightly greater than 45 degrees could be
   considered an intersection with the segment's boundary, if the longitude
   and latitude excursions are within margins.
<P>
 
   The goal is to ensure that any segment that the ray might hit is
   considered for a more detailed intercept computation.

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> DSK Type 2 Plate Expansion
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   By default, to eliminate the problem of false negatives from ray-surface
   intercept computations, where the surface is defined by the data in a
   selected type 2 segment, the DSK type 2 ray-surface intercept
   computation expands plates slightly before attempting to compute the
   ray's intersection with them. The expansion is done by scaling up, by a
   factor slightly greater than 1, each of a plate's centroid-vertex
   vectors. The expanded plate lies in the plane of the original plate, its
   edges are parallel to those of the original plate, and its centroid
   coincides with that of the original plate.

   Some DSK tolerance parameters do not strictly support ``greedy''
   behavior, but rather enhances the DSK software's usability. For example,
   there is a DSK parameter that is used to decide whether a longitude
   value is close enough to a segment's longitude range to be considered to
   lie within that range. Another tolerance parameter is used to decide
   whether angular values are valid. For example, a latitude that exceeds
   pi/2 radians by a positive number less than this tolerance is treated as
   though it were exactly pi/2.

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Drawbacks"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Drawbacks
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   A possible negative consequence of greedy algorithms is that some
   results derived using them may be quite different from those derived
   without them.
<P>
 
   For example, if a ray hits the edge of an expanded plate, and that plate
   has a maximum edge length of 1 km, then the ray might have missed the
   original plate by as much as 0.1 millimeters. After missing the original
   plate, the ray might hit the surface far from that plate, or it might
   miss the target altogether.
<P>
 
   This issue, while it may appear serious, is a normal consequence of
   using finite precision arithmetic. A comparable difference in results
   might be observed were the computation without plate expansion performed
   on two different computer systems.

   Vertices are vectors in three-dimensional space: each vertex is

   The center of a type 2 segment's reference frame need not coincide with

   Within a type 2 segment, vertex components are always expressed in units
   of km, regardless of the units associated with the input data from which
   the segment was constructed.

   Each vertex has an associated integer ID; vertex IDs range from 1 to NV,
   where NV is the number of vertices in the segment. This 1-based

   boundaries of solid objects---for example, a sphere---the outward normal
   direction has the usual meaning: it points toward the exterior of the
   object. For other surfaces, for example a single plate, the outward
   normal direction may be an arbitrary choice.
<P>
 
   The order of a plate's vertices implies the outward normal direction: if
   the vertices are
<P>
 
<PRE>
   V(1), V(2), V(3)
</PRE>
   then the outward normal direction is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   ( V(2) - V(1) )  x  ( V(3) - V(2) )
</PRE>
   where ``x'' denotes the vector cross product operator.
<P>
 
   DSK creators must take vertex order into account when they define the
   plates of a DSK type 2 segment.
<P>
 
   As the formula above shows, the outward normal direction is undefined if
   two or three vertices of a plate coincide; in this case the ``plate'' is
   actually a line segment or a point. Plates having these characteristics
   are termed ``degenerate.'' Even if all of a plate's vertices are
   distinct, the normal direction vector suffers great loss of precision if
   the angle between two plate edges is very close to zero.
<P>
 
   Degenerate and nearly degenerate plates are allowed in type 2 segments,
   but it is strongly recommended that DSK creators exclude them from input
   data sets. Such plates can cause run-time failures of user applications
   performing functions that require outward normal directions to exist,
   for example computing emission and solar incidence angles.
<P>
 
   Each plate has an associated integer ID; plate IDs range from 1 to NP,
   where NP is the number of plates in the segment. This 1-based numbering
   scheme is used for all language versions of SPICE, so the plate IDs in a
   DSK file match those used in SPICE DSK code on all platforms.

   Much of the ``added value'' provided by DSK type 2 segments derives from
   their spatial indexes: these enable rapid association between spatial
   regions and plates, and between vertices and plates.
<P>
 
   A DSK type 2 spatial index consists of a ``voxel-plate mapping'' and
   optionally, a ``vertex-plate mapping,'' as well as various associated

   In a DSK type 2 segment, integers that refer to locations of data or

   In a DSK type 2 segment, pointers and offsets are expressed relative to
   the DAS base addresses of that segment, or relative to the DAS addresses
   of other members of the segment. This ensures that the segment is
   ``relocatable'': it has no dependence on its absolute DAS addresses and
   can be moved or copied without corrupting its contents.

   The fine voxel grid is an array, also called a ``grid,'' of cubical
   regions in 3-dimensional space. The cubical regions are called ``fine
   voxels'' or simply ``voxels'' when the term is unambiguous. The overall
   shape of the grid is that of a box (a 3-dimensional solid having six
   rectangular sides).

   The sides of the grid are aligned with the coordinate axes of the DSK

   A segment's fine voxel grid contains all vertices in the segment (and

   the grid's boundary. Thus no point on or outside of the grid's boundary
   can touch a plate.

   voxel grid'' may refer to either the spatial region or the data
   structure, depending on context.

   The voxels of the coarse grid are cubes of identical size. The edge

   In the description below, the term ``integer'' refers to an element of
   the DAS integer address space.
<P>
 
   The DSK integer array representing the coarse voxel grid has one element
   for each coarse voxel. If any plates intersect the spatial region
   corresponding to a coarse voxel, the corresponding coarse voxel grid
   array element contains a pointer into the voxel-plate pointer array. If
   no plates intersect that spatial region, the voxel contains the value
   zero, which represents a null pointer. (Caution: for reasons of backward
   compatibility, the values zero and -1 are used in different parts of DSK
   type 2 segments indicate null pointers.)
<P>
 
   Note that during the construction of a spatial index, plate-voxel
   ``intersection'' may be determined using a margin so that plates very
   near a voxel are considered to intersect it. This is the case for DSK
   type 2 segments created by <a href="../cspice/dskw02_c.html">dskw02_c</a> and by MKDSK.
<P>
 
   A non-null pointer in a given coarse voxel is a 1-based index of a
   pointer set within the voxel-plate pointer array. The pointer set
   indicates the locations of plate lists associated with the fine voxels
   having the coarse voxel as a parent.

   The value is small enough to make it practical for DSK type 2 software

   In all DSK type 2 segments, SPICE_DSK02_MAXCGR integers are allocated

<H3> Purpose of the Coarse Voxel Grid
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Below, the term ``empty'' means ``not intersected by any plates.''
<P>
 
   The coarse voxel grid allows type 2 segments to avoid storing pointers
   for all fine voxels, since only fine voxels belonging to non-empty
   coarse voxels require pointers. Since in many practical cases, the
   majority of coarse voxels are empty, this often greatly reduces the
   required number of pointers.
<P>
 
   The coarse voxel grid also tends to reduce the number of physical file
   reads necessary to determine the plate set relevant to a given
   computation, since DSK type 2 software often can use it to quickly
   determine that a given fine voxel is empty, without looking up a
   voxel-plate pointer and then a plate list for that voxel. Any fine voxel
   that belongs to an empty coarse voxel is empty as well, and typically
   the majority of empty fine voxels do belong to empty coarse voxels.

<H3> Voxel-Plate Pointer Array
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The voxel-plate pointer array contains a contiguous set of pointers for
   each non-empty coarse voxel. There is one pointer for each fine voxel
   having the associated coarse voxel as a parent. Each such ``pointer'' is
   a 1-based index in the voxel-plate association array of the start of the
   plate list corresponding to a fine voxel. Null pointers in this
   structure are indicated by the value -1.
<P>
 
   The pointer set for a given coarse voxel contains one pointer for each
   fine voxel having that coarse voxel as a parent, so there are
<P>
 
<PRE>
         3
   CGRSCL

   pointers in each set.

   Let NNECVX indicate the number of non-empty coarse voxels. Then the

   The mapping from the coarse voxel grid to pointer sets in the
   voxel-plate pointer array is determined by the segment's data, the voxel
   grid parameters, and the order in which the data are processed. As
   indicated in the following diagram, no particular relationship should be

   Each pointer corresponds to a fine voxel in the coarse voxel associated

   1-dimensional array, the first fine voxel maps to the first pointer, and
   so on. The ordering of the fine voxels is Fortran-style, so a fine voxel

<P>
 
   Other than the optional vertex-plate association array, the voxel-plate
   association array is the largest ancillary data structure in a DSK type
   2 segment. The size, in units of integers, of this array is affected by
   the fine voxel scale, which is a user-selectable parameter. For a given
   plate and vertex set, the size of fine voxels varies in proportion to
   the fine voxel scale.
<P>
 
   Let NVOXPL be the size, in units of integers, of the voxel-plate
   association array; as above, let NNEFVX be the total count of non-empty
   fine voxels; let NP be the segment's plate count. A lower bound on
   NVOXPL is
<P>
 
<PRE>
 
   NNEFVX + NP
 
</PRE>
   This number reflects the plate counts for the plate lists of each
   non-empty fine voxel, plus the presence of each plate ID on at least one
   list.
<P>
 
   Normally, a large number of plates cross voxel boundaries and so have
   their IDs on multiple lists. Hence NVOXPL is normally larger than the
   lower bound shown above.
<P>
 
   Reducing the fine voxel size improves the discrimination of the fine
   grid, which can improve the efficiency of algorithms that must operate
   on plates associated with a specified spatial region. For example, in
   the ray-surface intercept computation, the count of plates associated
   with voxels intersected by the ray will usually decrease as the voxel
   size is reduced.
<P>
 
   However, as the fine voxel size is reduced, more plates cross voxel
   boundaries---such plates are on the plate list of each voxel they
   touch---and NVOXPL increases. The memory required to hold the spatial
   index increases as well; it may become too large to allow a program
   calling <a href="../cspice/dskw02_c.html">dskw02_c</a> (the utility MKDSK is one such program) to run
   successfully. If a DSK segment with a very large value of NVOXPL is
   successfully created, its large size may have a detrimental effect on
   disk access time.

   Recall that a ``plate'' is a 3-tuple of integer vertex IDs. Given a
   vertex ID, the vertex-plate mapping enables DSK software to quickly find
   the plates that include that vertex ID as one of their own. This enables
   geometric algorithms to quickly find the plates that lie close to a
   given plate.
<P>
 
   Currently (as of the time of release of the N0066 SPICE Toolkit) there
   are no CSPICE routines that rely on the vertex-plate mapping. Creation
   of this mapping is therefore optional. Both the DSK type 2 writer
   function <a href="../cspice/dskw02_c.html">dskw02_c</a> and the utility program MKDSK enable users to indicate
   whether to create a vertex-plate mapping in an output DSK segment.

   other inputs equal, can make the difference between a ray-surface
   intersection and non-intersection, or between spacecraft altitude
   measured relative to a plateau vs terrain at the base of a cliff.
<P>
 
   These problems are best avoided at the time application software is
   designed: software developers must account for the effects of round-off
   error.

<H2> Non-Convex and Multi-Valued Surfaces
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Non-convex surfaces can thwart logic that is valid for triaxial
   ellipsoid models. For example, at a given point on a non-convex surface,
   for a specified observer, an emission angle of less than 90 degrees
   doesn't necessarily imply that the point is visible from the observer.
   Similarly, a solar incidence angle of less than 90 degrees doesn't
   necessarily imply the point is illuminated by the sun.
<P>
 
   Even a slight deviation from convexity can change numerical results
   considerably from those obtained using a triaxial ellipsoid model. For
   example, depending on whether there is a mountain in the foreground or
   whether the intercept lies in a valley (oriented in the general
   direction of the ray's projection on the surface), the range from an
   observer to a ray-surface intercept point can be much shorter or longer
   than the distance to the ray's intercept on the target body's reference
   ellipsoid.
<P>
 
   Non-convex surfaces can, in some cases, render some geometric quantities
   undefined or unusable. For example, the nearest surface point to a given
   point, not on the surface, can have multiple solutions, all in
   substantially different directions from the given point. Another
   example: the origin of a body-fixed reference frame for an object may be
   outside of the object--- a surface modeling a planetary ring would have
   this property.
<P>
 
   Multi-valued surfaces are those for which, for a given latitude and
   longitude, or for a given (X,Y) value, there are multiple radius or
   height values. These surfaces can occur due to presence of topographic
   features such as cliffs, caves, and arches. They can also occur due to
   the large-scale shape of an object, as is the case for the nucleus of
   the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
<P>
 
   Multi-valued surfaces invite new categories of errors not possible with
   single-valued, non-convex surfaces. For example, for a given observer
   position, the sub-observer point can vary depending on the observer's
   altitude. Software meant for use with single-valued surfaces, for
   example the function <a href="../cspice/latsrf_c.html">latsrf_c</a>, may yield incorrect results for such
   cases.
<P>
 
   Multi-valued surfaces can yield discontinuities in derived quantities
   that are well-behaved when an ellipsoid is used to model the target's
   shape. For example, when an observing spacecraft overflies a cliff, the
   observer's altitude can change discontinuously. If the sub-spacecraft
   point is corrected for light time, the light time algorithm may converge
   slowly or not at all.
<P>
 
   Again, these problems are best solved by designing application software
   to avoid assumptions appropriate only for ellipsoids.

   Some data properties are allowed by MKDSK and <a href="../cspice/dskw02_c.html">dskw02_c</a>, but result in
   DSK segments that may be unsuitable for some computations. These
   include:

<A NAME="Segment Coverage Errors"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Segment Coverage Errors
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   It is possible for DSK creators to create segments that don't have the
   coverage claimed in the segments' DSK descriptors and intended by the
   creator to be present.
<P>
 
   This is an easy error to make when a large data set is distributed
   across multiple DSK files. The DSK creator may assume that the original
   plate set, partitioned among various files, will yield the same coverage
   as if all plates were stored in a single segment. Not so---each segment
   can only provide the coverage its DSK descriptor claims it has, so if a
   plate needed by a segment to provide coverage near, but within, that
   segment's boundary is allocated to a different segment, the first
   segment's coverage will have a gap.
<P>
 
   An artificial, but simple, example of this is a tessellation of a
   sphere, using triangular plates. Suppose that the surface is partitioned
   into a 6 x 12 grid of segments, each covering a 30 degree by 30 degree
   region of planetocentric longitude and latitude. Suppose each segment
   contains 225 pairs of plates such that each pair covers a
   longitude-latitude rectangle having angular extent 2 degrees by 2
   degrees, so each segment is ``covered'' by 450 plates.
<P>
 
   Consider the segment covering the coordinate rectangle
<P>
 
<PRE>
   Planetocentric longitude (deg):    0 to +30
   Planetocentric latitude  (deg):  +30 to +60
</PRE>
   For each plate having two vertices on the segment's southern boundary,
   the edge of that plate connecting those vertices has latitude greater
   than 30 degrees everywhere but at the vertices themselves. At the
   midpoint of that edge, the latitude is actually about 30.00378 degrees.
<P>
 
   A ray aimed from an exterior vertex to the center of the sphere will
   miss the surface if the longitude of the vertex is 15 degrees and
   latitude of the vertex is above 30 degrees but less than the latitude of
   the edge's midpoint.
<P>
 
   The solution is to create each segment using ``padding''---additional
   plates extending slightly beyond the segment's southern boundary, so no
   ray emanating from the origin and hitting the sphere within the
   segment's longitude-latitude coverage can miss all of the segment's
   plates.
<P>
 
   The same problem exists for all southern segment latitude boundaries
   having positive latitude, and for all northern segment latitude
   boundaries having negative latitude. All of these boundaries require
   padding in order to achieve the intended coverage.

<A NAME="Poor Data Distribution Across Segments"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Poor Data Distribution Across Segments
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   It's possible to create DSK segments that are technically valid but that
   give rise to very slow run-time performance.
<P>
 
   A seemingly attractive choice that can lead to this problem is
   partitioning a large data set into a small number of files, each of
   which contains a large number of plates.
<P>
 
   Type 2 segments can contain 10000000 or more plates (see Appendix B),
   but as a segment's plate count increases, the speed of DSK ray-surface
   intercept computations decreases.
<P>
 
   Experience indicates that DSK ray-surface intercepts exhibit an
   ``economy of small scale'' phenomenon, whereby spreading data across
   multiple, small segments tends to improve performance. This is true only
   up to a point: as the number of segments grows, the amount of time spent
   reading new data when switching from one segment to another grows. At
   some point this overhead becomes a significant drag on performance.
