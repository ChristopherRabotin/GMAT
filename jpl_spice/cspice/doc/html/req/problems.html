<H2> Abstract

   Descriptions of the more commonly encountered SPICE problems, broken
   down into functional areas with suggestions on how to avoid problems.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Introduction"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Introduction
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   While NAIF strives to make correct use of SPICE an effortless
   experience, more remains to be done. NAIF's decade of experience with
   SPICE customers shows certain problems seem to recur fairly regularly.
   This document aims to assist you in preventing these problems, or if
   necessary, troubleshooting them.
<P>
 
   Most of this document is concerned with matching symptoms to possible
   causes and solutions. However, before starting to write a SPICE-based
   application, we strongly encourage you to consider the steps necessary
   to avoid problems.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Getting it Right"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Getting it Right
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   It's generally much easier and quicker to make sure you're doing things
   right in the first place than it is to explain why your program isn't
   behaving as expected. For best results, carefully ascertain you have the
   proper input data and problem definition before proceeding.
<P>
 
   One of the most frequently occurring user-support questions fielded by
   NAIF is basically ``I compared my results from SPICE with [an alternate
   source], and they disagree. Why?'' The answer usually is the two
   computations are for some unintended reason solving different problems.
<P>
 
   Here's a checklist of things to get right before embarking on solving a
   problem with SPICE, or comparing SPICE results with those obtained from
   alternate sources.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> Read the directions: read the relevant SPICE documentation, both function
headers and Required Reading files. SPICE software interfaces aspire to be
intuitively clear, but may fall short.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> Understand the definitions: many geometric quantities have a variety of
definitions. For example, there are a variety of ways of computing a
sub-observer point, involving both different applications of light time
corrections and different definitions of ``sub-point'' (closest point to
the observer vs. surface intercept of observer-target center vector).
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> Understand the expected accuracy and precision: for example, the
Astronomical Almanac frequently presents results having claimed accuracy of
0.01 degree. These cannot be expected to agree with SPICE results at the
arcsecond level. On the other hand, if your application requires
extraordinarily high accuracy, you may need to check whether SPICE meets
your requirements.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>4.</TT> Use the right files: this is probably the single most frequent cause of
disagreements. You MUST use the same ephemeris, rotational elements, shape
models, pointing, instrument models, frame definitions, leapseconds,
spacecraft clock coefficients, and so forth if you're attempting to match
results from alternative computations.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>5.</TT> Use the right time: another major cause of disagreements. Is the input time
supposed to be UTC, ``ET'' or TDB (barycentric dynamical time), TDT
(terrestrial dynamical time), TAI, etc.? Frequently calendar dates and
Julian dates are written down without specification of whether they're UTC
or TDB, even though the distinction is critical for high-accuracy work.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>&#32;&#32;</TT> In order for SPICE-based time conversions to be correct, current
leapseconds and/or SCLK (spacecraft clock) kernels are essential.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>6.</TT> Use the right reference frame: state vectors will not compare well if
they're specified relative to different reference frames. ``EME50'' frames
are problematic because there are a variety of similar but non-identical
frames all designated by this name. Examples are: B1950, FK4, DE-125.
Implementations of body-fixed frames may differ as well. Also, some
extended bodies have a variety of frames associated with them: Jupiter
system I vs. system III for example.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>7.</TT> Use the right coordinate system: sometimes disagreements result from
mismatched coordinate systems, for example planetocentric vs. planetodetic
coordinates.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>8.</TT> Use the right aberration corrections: there can be a large difference
between geometric (uncorrected) states and states corrected for light-time
or light time and stellar aberration. When computing quantities involving
surface locations on extended bodies, whether or not the rotation is
retarded by light time is an issue.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>9.</TT> Use the current software: out-of-date Toolkits may contain bugs corrected
in the current release.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>10.</TT> When diagnosing a problem, make sure a problem exists. Correct answers are
sometimes counterintuitive. Not infrequently, a disagreement between a
SPICE result and a ``cross-check'' result occurs because the latter is not
mathematically equivalent to the former.
<BR><BR></UL>
   In the discussion below, it's implicit that any of the problem areas
   listed above should be examined whenever you diagnose a failure.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>

<H2> Accuracy
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   While for general applications, SPICE is usually capable of much higher
   accuracy than required, for some specialized applications such as radio
   science, certain SPICE-based computations may not be sufficiently
   accurate.

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Problem: Arithmetic on time values yields incorrect results
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Within the SPICE system TDB times are represented as double precision
   numbers, and these are not generally accurate to better than 1.E-7
   second.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Problem: States from the SPK and NAVIO systems are not identical"></A>

<H3> Problem: States from the SPK and NAVIO systems are not identical
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   This problem to date has proved illusory.
<P>
 
   State vectors obtained from SPK files have been tested and shown to
   agree with those obtained from the parent NAVIO files to levels orders
   of magnitude below the knowledge error in the data. The differences in
   state vectors returned by the two systems tend to reflect round-off
   level differences in the handling of time.

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Problem: UTC-TDB conversion in SPICE does not appear accurate
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   This is not truly a common problem; it has arisen only in the context of
   radio science applications.
<P>
 
   The UTC-TDB conversion in SPICE is accurate to about 4.E-5 seconds.

<H3> Problem: Light time corrections in SPICE seem to be inaccurate
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Versions of the SPICE Toolkit released prior to May, 1995 used an
   unnecessarily inaccurate light time computation: they returned the
   distance between the geometric positions of observer and target at the
   request time, divided by the speed of light. Later versions of SPICE use
   the position of the target evaluated at the light-time corrected epoch.
<P>
 
   Be aware the SPICE aberration corrections do not account for
   relativistic effects.

<H3> Problem: Inertial/Bodyfixed position conversion gives SPICE error
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Make sure you're using the correct ID code for the body.
<P>
 
   Check your kernel file lists data for the body in question at the epoch
   of interest. If you're using a text PCK, this problem occurs because
   data is simply absent for the body in question.
<P>
 
   Binary PCK files have coverage for limited time spans. Make sure the
   request time falls within the coverage interval for the body if a binary
   PCK is used. The available coverage may be ascertained by summarizing
   the PCK file with SPACIT.
<P>
 
   If the rotation of the body is retarded by one-way light time, remember
   PCK data for the body must be available at the light-time corrected
   epoch.

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Problem: Inertial/Bodyfixed position conversion is incorrect
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Rotational models for extended bodies vary. For any given body, the
   model and model parameter values may evolve over time, so verify the
   version you're using is correct.
<P>
 
   Some bodies have rotational models based on different physical
   attributes, for example rotation of the magnetic field or rotation of
   the atmosphere. Confirm the model you expect is provided by the PCK file
   you're using.
<P>
 
   The epoch at which the target body's orientation should be evaluated
   depends on whether the actual or apparent orientation of the body is to
   be computed. Check whether the request epoch should be adjusted for
   light time.
<P>

<H3> Problem: Inertial/Body-fixed state conversion is incorrect
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   All of the considerations listed above apply.
<P>
 
   Additionally, note that velocity transformations involve the time
   derivative of the inertial-to-bodyfixed transformation. If P and V are
   inertially-referenced position and velocity vectors, M is the
   inertial-to-bodyfixed transformation matrix, and P_b and V_b are the
   body-fixed position and velocity, then we have (by the Chain Rule for
   derivatives):
<P>
 
<PRE>
   P_b = M*P
   V_b = M*V +  (dM/dt)*P
</PRE>
   Some applications external to SPICE erroneously ignore the second term
   in the second equation.

<H3> Problem: How does one determine the attributes of a C-kernel?
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Use CKBRIEF or SPACIT to summarize the kernel. Depending on your
   computer system, you may need to log the output to a file to view it
   conveniently.
<P>
 
   C-kernel data are contained in a series of one or more chunks called
   ``segments.'' SPACIT will output a series of summaries, one for each
   segment. SPACIT will tell you what instrument the pointing data is for,
   which base frame the pointing is referenced to, whether angular velocity
   data are also present in the segment, and the data type (internal
   representation) of the segment. The time bounds of each segment are also
   shown.
<P>
 
   CKBRIEF is a more flexible and robust summary program than SPACIT; you
   normally will find CKBRIEF more convenient to use. However, the current
   version of CKBRIEF does not output the data types of segments.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Problem: no pointing found at desired epoch"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Problem: no pointing found at desired epoch
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Check the ID code you're supplying to the CK reader matches that in the
   C-kernel. If you're interested in pointing for a spacecraft instrument,
   you may need to get pointing for another entity, usually the spacecraft
   bus or a scan platform, then apply pointing offsets from a Frame kernel
   or Instrument kernel to obtain instrument pointing.
<P>
 
   If the ID code is correct, it may be the tolerance value supplied to the
   C-kernel reader function, either <a href="../cspice/ckgp_c.html">ckgp_c</a> or <a href="../cspice/ckgpav_c.html">ckgpav_c</a>, should be
   increased. By increasing the tolerance value you supply to the CK reader
   called in your application, you may be able to pick up pointing at a
   nearby time sufficiently close to your time of interest.
<P>
 
   There may be no nearby pointing due to coverage gaps in the C-kernel,
   either between segments or in the interior of some segment. C-kernel
   segments, unlike SPK segments, do not necessarily have continuous
   coverage. In fact, type 1 C-kernels contain discrete pointing and do not
   yield interpolated pointing. C-kernel data types 2-4 have coverage over
   a series of time intervals, but there may be gaps between the intervals.
<P>
 
   Finally, you may be using the CK wrong reader. The reader <a href="../cspice/ckgpav_c.html">ckgpav_c</a>
   returns pointing data only if pointing data AND angular velocity data
   exists at the request time. You should use <a href="../cspice/ckgp_c.html">ckgp_c</a> if your C-kernel lacks
   angular velocity data as <a href="../cspice/ckgp_c.html">ckgp_c</a> doesn't require the presence such data.
<P>

<A NAME="Problem: unclear what lookup tolerance to use"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Problem: unclear what lookup tolerance to use
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The choice of lookup tolerance can be a complex issue involving
   trade-offs between accuracy and completing as much data processing as
   possible. Choosing a non-zero tolerance means accepting pointing for a
   time other than your time of interest. What magnitude of inaccuracy is
   introduced by this choice? It depends on how much the structure of
   interest can or did move during the tolerance interval. Knowledge of the
   spacecraft or structure dynamics may be required to select the maximum
   acceptable tolerance. This may vary depending on mission phase, ACS
   (attitude control system) state, the specific structure for which
   pointing is desired, or other time-dependent factors.
<P>
 
   There are a few cases that do admit simple guidelines:
<P>
 
   If you're using a type 1 C-kernel (discrete pointing), the tolerance
   should normally be at least half the nominal spacing between the
   pointing instances. Otherwise, no pointing will be found at request
   times near the midpoints between times where pointing is available.
<P>
 
   If you're using a C-kernel of type 2, 3, or 4, and you know the data
   does not suffer from gaps, you may use a tolerance of zero. This choice
   guarantees you'll get pointing interpolated to your request time. A
   tolerance of zero is frequently acceptable when using predict pointing,
   which normally should not have any coverage anomalies.

   For queries not involving the ordering of output, this sometimes happens
   because inadequate constraints were supplied. Queries on large databases

<A NAME="Problem: Logical unit conflict"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Problem: Logical unit conflict
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Logical unit conflicts are peculiar to FORTRAN applications. However,
   they may occur in C applications that link to both CSPICE and other C
   code generated by running f2c on FORTRAN source code.
<P>
 
   The SPICE kernel loaders allocate logical units at run time. SPICE does
   not allocate logical units currently in use.
<P>
 
   If a user application loads kernels or otherwise performs actions that
   cause SPICE to allocate logical units, and then uses those same logical
   units for its own I/O operations, a logical unit conflict exists. SPICE
   will then attempt to read from whatever file the application has
   connected to the logical units SPICE had allocated. This will typically
   result in SPICE reading something other than valid kernel data.
<P>
 
   There are a couple of simple solutions. First, if an application is
   known to use a particular set of units, you can tell SPICE not to touch
   those units by calling reslun_.
<P>
 
   If you are writing a new application, it may be convenient to use
   getlun_ to allocate logical units at run time. This avoids hard-coded
   logical units, which may cause portability and integration problems.

   The SPICE DAS system, which underlies the EK system, requires a scratch
   file for sorting when a newly written file is closed. Attempting to open
   this file could cause a system limit on open files or logical units to
   be encountered, resulting in a file open error.
<P>
 
   If the application does not have permission to open the scratch file, an
   error will be signaled. See also ``File I/O.''
<P>
 
   If the scratch file is opened successfully, it is possible the disk
   space will be exhausted while writing to the file. This will result in a

<H3> Problem: A text kernel causes a SPICE(INCOMPATIBLEEOL) error
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   These problems usually occur after accidentally performing a binary ftp
   transfer of the text file in question. SPICE use of such files can be
   expected to work only if the transfer is between systems having
   identical text file formats.
<P>
 
   It is also possible the file was corrupted in transfer due to running
   out of disk space on the target system during the transfer.
<P>
 
   SPICE Toolkits since version N57 include an error check to text file
   readers to ensure the files had the correct line terminators for the
   platform. NAIF added this check as loading non-native text kernels
   proved a continual problem for SPICE users - trying to load a non-native
   kernel usually caused no change to the kernel pool state resulting in
   unexpected results and confused users.
<P>
 
   Most (if not all) modern Microsoft compilers perform an internal
   conversion from DOS terminators to Unix terminators, explaining why one
   seldom saw this problem on Windows.
<P>
 
   As of Toolkit version N59, CSPICE/Icy text kernel loaders perform the
   conversion between text line terminators on Windows and Unix platforms;
   SPICELIB (the FORTRAN toolkit library) lacks this conversion capability
   and so signals INCOMPATIBLEEOL.
<P>

   binary kernel, TOBIN can often diagnose file corruption when attempting

   If the file was transferred between two systems with compatible binary

   may be due to accidentally having transferred the file in ASCII rather
   than binary ftp mode.
<P>
 
   Also, it is possible the disk space was exhausted on the target system
   during the transfer.
<P>
 
   If the file was transferred between two systems with incompatible binary
   file formats, for example an HP workstation and a PC, the problem is
   that binary kernels on one system are not designed to work on the other.
   The kernel must be converted to transfer format on the source system,
   the transfer format file must be transferred in ASCII mode, and the
   received transfer file must be converted back to binary format on the
   target system. Use TOXFR and TOBIN, respectively, to perform conversions
   from binary to transfer format and from transfer format to binary
   format. The utility SPACIT is also capable of performing these
   conversions. See the User's Guides for any of these utilities --

<H3> Problem: SPICE-based application is too slow
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Loading kernel files in a loop causes slow execution. Normally, kernel
   files should be loaded once per program run, usually during
   initialization.
<P>
 
   Two possible ``global'' improvements are using compiler optimization and
   disabling CSPICE call tracing.
<P>
 
   The FORTRAN library SPICELIB is normally built without using compiler
   optimization. On some systems, in particular Sun Sparc machines running
   Sun FORTRAN, using optimization has resulted in some code generation
   errors. NAIF is working to resolve this problem. CSPICE on the other
   hand is always built using compiler optimization. If you have the
   opportunity to use either library, using CSPICE may result in a
   considerable speed-up.
<P>
 
   CSPICE applications can be somewhat sped up by disabling the function
   call tracing done internally by CSPICE. This is done by calling <a href="../cspice/trcoff_c.html">trcoff_c</a>
   once during program initialization:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/trcoff_c.html">trcoff_c</a>();
</PRE>
   Normally it is desirable to retain CSPICE's call tracing while an
   application is still being debugged. See Error Required Reading,
   <a href="../req/error.html">error.req</a>, or the header of <a href="../cspice/trcoff_c.html">trcoff_c</a> for further information.
<P>
 
   It's also possible to achieve speed gains via local code modifications.
   Before trying this, it's a good idea to profile your application to
   locate bottlenecks.
<P>
 
   Often it's possible to re-organize your SPICE calls so as to minimize
   the number of expensive operations. There is usually a speed/complexity
   trade-off to consider when making such changes. For example, if you're
   computing a large number of geometric quantities that all require the
   same spacecraft-to-target state vector, and each quantity is computed by
   a separate function, you may want to compute the state vector once and
   pass it into the geometry routines.
<P>
 
   Sometimes speed gains can be achieved by calling lower-level CSPICE
   functions. For example, if you're computing the apparent states of many
   targets as seen from a single observer at a given epoch, rather than
   using the high-level reader <a href="../cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>, you can look up the observer state
   relative to the solar system barycenter via <a href="../cspice/spkssb_c.html">spkssb_c</a>, then separately
   look up each apparent target state relative to the solar system
   barycenter via <a href="../cspice/spkapp_c.html">spkapp_c</a>. This eliminates redundant computations of the
   observer's state.

   Good question. SPICE does not currently contain routines that provide a

<P>
 
   It is possible to examine loaded kernels at run time to determine their
   coverage. This is done via the DAF search functions. See the DAF

<H3> Problem: SPICE(SPKINSUFFDATA) error is signaled
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The most common reason for this is that the user neglected to load a
   necessary SPK file.
<P>
 
   Computation of aberration-corrected states requires that sufficient data
   be available to compute the observer and target states relative to the
   solar system barycenter. The target state must be computable over the
   interval from the request time back to the request time minus one-way
   light-time. So don't request an aberration-corrected state at or near
   the coverage start time of an SPK file.

<H3> Problem: no data found for times near SPK endpoints
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   SPK coverage boundaries shown by SPACIT are approximate.
<P>
 
   Also, if aberration corrections are used, state requests will result in
   look-ups of the target state for epochs prior to the request time. See
   ``SPICE(SPKINSUFFDATA) error is signaled'' above.

<H3> Problem: states vary over different program runs
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   If multiple SPK files contain ``competing'' data, that is redundant
   ephemeris data for a given body, center and time, then the SPK system
   selects the data based on the order in which the competing files were
   loaded, with files loaded last taking precedence.
<P>
 
   Varying the order in which the files were loaded can affect the state
   vectors returned by the SPK system.
<P>
 
   Of course, any change in the set of kernels used may affect results
   computed by the SPICE system.

<H3> Problem: System barycenter-relative states are inconsistent

   Note that system barycenter locations change as mass estimates change.
<P>
 
   The solar system barycenter is very sensitive to mass estimates for the
   outer planetary systems. Therefore, state vectors of bodies relative to
   the solar system barycenter cannot be expected to compare well across
   planetary SPK files based on different integrations (having different
   underlying planetary ephemerides).
