   The SCLK system is the component of SPICE concerned with spacecraft
   clock correlation data.

<A NAME="Introduction"></A>

<H2> Introduction
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The spacecraft clock is the onboard time-keeping mechanism that triggers
   most spacecraft events, such as shuttering of a camera. Since telemetry
   data are downlinked with this clock's time attached to it, spacecraft
   clock time (SCLK--pronounced ``s-clock'') is the fundamental time
   measurement for referencing many spacecraft activities.
<P>
 
   It is natural, then, that SCLK have an important role in the CSPICE
   system. In fact, all C-kernel pointing data are referenced to SCLK.
   CSPICE contains functions to convert between SCLK and other standard
   time systems, such as Ephemeris Time (ET) and Universal Time Coordinated
   (UTC).

   The suite of SCLK functions has been designed to easily accommodate
   future missions. A later section describes how the system might be
   easily expanded to incorporate new spacecraft clocks.

<H3> Detection of Non-native Text Files
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Starting with the N0057 release of the SPICE Toolkit (March, 2004) the
   SPICE data loading mechanism detects and prohibits loading text kernel
   files containing lines terminated with EOF character(s) non-native to
   the platform on which the Toolkit was compiled. If a non-native EOL
   terminator is detected in the first 132 characters of a text kernel, the
   execution is stopped and an error message is displayed. This feature
   does not work with files that are smaller that 132 bytes or have the
   first line longer that 132 characters.

<A NAME="The Basics"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> The Basics
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   In this section, we present a minimal subset of facts about the CSPICE
   SCLK system that you can get by with and still use the system
   successfully.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="SCLK rates"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> SCLK rates
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Most of the complexity of dealing with SCLK time values arises from the
   fact that the rate at which any spacecraft clock runs varies over time.
   As a consequence, the relationship between SCLK and ET or UTC is not
   accurately described by a linear function; usually, a piecewise linear
   function is used to model this relationship.
<P>
 
   The mapping that models the relationship between SCLK and other time
   systems is updated as a mission progresses. While the change in the
   relationship between SCLK and other systems will usually be small, you
   should be aware that it exists; it may be a cause of discrepancies
   between results produced by different sets of software.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="SCLK kernels"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> SCLK kernels
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   SCLK files conform to a flexible format called ``NAIF text kernel''
   format. The SPICE file identification word provided by itself on the
   first line of a text SCLK file is ``KPL/SCLK''. Both the NAIF text
   kernel format and SPICE file identification word are described in detail
   in the Kernel Required Reading document, <a href="../req/kernel.html">kernel.req</a>.
<P>
 
   To use any of the SCLK conversion functions, your program must first
   load a SCLK kernel file. The code fragment
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> ( &lt;name of the SCLK kernel file goes here&gt; );
</PRE>
   accomplishes this. You must supply the actual name of the kernel file
   you want to load.
<P>
 
   In addition, you will usually need to load a leapseconds kernel. For
   some missions, conversions between SCLK and ET will require that both an
   SCLK and a leapseconds kernel be loaded. The code fragment
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> ( &lt;name of the LEAPSECONDS kernel file goes here&gt; );
</PRE>
   loads a leapseconds kernel. Leapseconds kernels are described in the
   TIME required reading document, <a href="../req/time.html">time.req</a>.
<P>
 
   Normally, you will load these kernels at just one point in your
   application program, prior to using any time conversion functions.
<P>
 
   Details concerning the kernel pool are covered in the KERNEL required
   reading document, <a href="../req/kernel.html">kernel.req</a>.

<A NAME="Partitions, briefly"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Partitions, briefly
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The lifetime of each mission is divided into intervals called
   ``partitions.'' Partitions are time intervals during which the
   spacecraft clock advances continuously. Every time that a discontinuity
   in a spacecraft clock's readout values occurs, a new partition is
   started. Discontinuities may consist of positive jumps, in which the
   spacecraft clock's readout ``skips'' ahead, or negative jumps, in which
   the spacecraft clock regresses.
<P>
 
   The fact that a spacecraft clock may regress raises the possibility that
   the clock may give the same reading at two or more different times. For
   this reason, SCLK strings in CSPICE are prefaced with partition numbers.
<P>
 
   The partition number is a positive integer followed by a forward slash,
   for example
<P>
 
<PRE>
   4 /
</PRE>
   Any number of blanks are allowed on either side of the slash.
<P>
 
   An example of a Galileo SCLK string with a partition number is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   1/100007:76:1
</PRE>
   Partition numbers serve to ensure that spacecraft clock readings can be
   interpreted unambiguously.

   The CSPICE C kernel (CK) system tags CK data with SCLK times. Within the
   CK system, these time tags are encoded as double precision numbers. To

   CK reader functions.

<P>
 
   Encoded SCLK values can be converted to strings using the code fragment

   You can obtain continuous encoded SCLK values from ET via the function

   <a href="../cspice/sce2c_c.html">sce2c_c</a> ( sc, et, &amp;sclkdp );

   encodes the ephemeris time ET as the double precision value `sclkdp'.
   SCLKDP need not be integral; even though non-integral tick values do not
   represent SCLK readings, they are permitted to avoid truncation error
   when representing ET as encoded SCLK.
<P>
 
   A parallel routine <a href="../cspice/sce2t_c.html">sce2t_c</a> converts ET to encoded SCLK, rounding the
   result to the nearest integral tick.
<P>
 
   The inverse conversion is provided by the routine <a href="../cspice/sct2e_c.html">sct2e_c</a>, which is
   called as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/sct2e_c.html">sct2e_c</a> ( sc, sclkdp, &amp;et );
</PRE>
   SCT2E handles integral or continuous tick values as inputs.
<P>
 
   There is a special function that is used for encoding ``tolerance''
   values for the CK readers. (See the CK Required Reading, <a href="../req/ck.html">ck.req</a>,
   document for a discussion of the CK readers.)
<P>
 
   The code fragment
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/sctiks_c.html">sctiks_c</a> ( sc, clkstr, &amp;ticks );
</PRE>
   produces an encoded tolerance value. <a href="../cspice/sctiks_c.html">sctiks_c</a> takes SCLK strings WITHOUT
   partition numbers as inputs; this is because the strings indicate a
   delta time rather than an absolute time.
<P>
 
   All of the concepts used in this section are discussed in greater detail
   in the following sections of this document.

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Encoded SCLK"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Encoded SCLK
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The fundamental representation of SCLK in the CSPICE system is a double
   precision numeric encoding of each multi-component count. Encoding SCLK
   provides the following advantages:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Encoding makes for a more compact representation. Direct (un-encoded)
representation of spacecraft clock counts usually requires multiple numbers
for the separate components making up the SCLK count.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Having a single numeric equivalent for each count makes it much easier to
compare SCLK times (Is time t1 greater than time t2? Is time t1 closer to
time t2 than time t3? And so on.)
<BR><BR></UL>
   For these reasons, encoded SCLK is the time representation that is
   associated with pointing data in the C-kernel. Encoded SCLK is the basis
   by which conversions are made from SCLK to other time systems.
<P>
 
   To convert a character representation of an SCLK count `sclkch' to its
   double precision encoding `sclkdp', use the function <a href="../cspice/scencd_c.html">scencd_c</a> (Encode
   SCLK):
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/scencd_c.html">scencd_c</a> ( sc, sclkch, &amp;sclkdp );
</PRE>
   The function <a href="../cspice/scdecd_c.html">scdecd_c</a> (Decode SCLK) recovers the character
   representation of spacecraft clock from its double precision encoding.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/scdecd_c.html">scdecd_c</a> ( sc, sclkdp, lenout, sclkch );
</PRE>
   The first argument to both functions, `sc', is the NAIF integer ID for
   the spacecraft whose clock count is being encoded or decoded (for
   example, --32 for Voyager 2). Each spacecraft may have a different
   format for its clock counts, so the encoding scheme may be different for
   each.
<P>
 
   Later chapters describing clock types give complete details on clock
   string formats for spacecraft clocks supported by the CSPICE Toolkit.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Ticks"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Ticks
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The units of encoded SCLK are ``ticks since spacecraft clock start,''
   where a ``tick'' is defined to be the shortest time increment
   expressible by a particular spacecraft's clock.
<P>
 
   An analogy can be drawn with a standard wall clock, showing hours,
   minutes, and seconds. One tick for a wall clock would be one second. And
   a wall clock time of
<P>
 
<PRE>
   10:05:50
</PRE>
   would represent
<P>
 
<PRE>
   10(3600) + 5(60) + 50 = 36350
</PRE>
   ticks.
<P>
 
   As in the case of the wall clock, the length of time associated with a
   tick varies as the clock rate varies.
<P>
 
   Since not all spacecraft clocks are the same, the particular time value
   for one tick varies from spacecraft to spacecraft. For Mars Global
   Surveyor, for instance, one tick is equivalent to approximately four
   milliseconds. For Galileo, it's about 8 1/3 milliseconds.
<P>
 
   In addition to representing spacecraft clock readings, ticks can be used
   to represent arbitrary epochs. In order to minimize discretization
   error, ``continuous'' (non-integral) tick values are supported:
   ephemeris times may be converted to non-integral ticks via the function
   <a href="../cspice/sce2c_c.html">sce2c_c</a>.
<P>
 
   Conversion of spacecraft clock strings to ticks always produces integral
   tick values.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Partitions"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Partitions
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   One desirable feature of encoded SCLK is that it increases continuously
   throughout the course of the mission. Unfortunately, real spacecraft
   clocks do not always behave so nicely. A clock may reset to a lower
   value, rendering certain counts ambiguous. This might happen if the
   clock has reached its maximum expression, or because of a power surge. A
   clock may also jump ahead.
<P>
 
   Any time one of these discontinuities occurs, we say that SCLK time has
   entered a new partition. The partitions must be accounted for when
   encoding and decoding SCLK.
<P>
 
   To continue our analogy, say our wall clock was being used to keep time
   throughout an entire day. Then 10:05:50 is ambiguous, because we don't
   know if it falls in the morning or evening ``partition.'' So we append
   the indicators ``a.m.''\ or ``p.m.''\ to be clear.
<P>
 
   We handle SCLK similarly. Instead of just converting a clock count to
   ticks (10:05:50 to 36350), we take into account the partition that the
   count falls in, and compute the number of ticks since clock start
   (10:05:50 a.m. to 36350; 10:05:50 p.m. to 36350 + 12(60)(60) = 79550).
<P>
 
   When you pass a SCLK string to <a href="../cspice/scencd_c.html">scencd_c</a>, it is normally prefixed with a
   number indicating the partition in which the count falls. Sample SCLK
   strings for Voyager 2, including partition numbers, are given in an
   example program later in this document.
<P>
 
   The presence of the partition number is not always required. If it is
   missing, <a href="../cspice/scencd_c.html">scencd_c</a> will assume the partition to be the earliest one
   possible that contains the clock string being encoded. It's good
   practice to always include the partition number in SCLK strings.
<P>
 
   To convert to ticks since clock start, <a href="../cspice/scencd_c.html">scencd_c</a> processes the partition
   number. It has to know how many ticks were in all preceding partitions,
   and what the start and stop clock values were for each. This information
   is stored in a SCLK kernel file for that spacecraft. The SCLK kernel
   file is described in detail in a later section.
<P>
 
   New partitions may occur at any time throughout the course of active
   missions. The responsible mission operations team must update the SCLK
   kernel file to include new partitions as they occur.
<P>
 
   In converting encoded SCLK back to an equivalent clock string, <a href="../cspice/scdecd_c.html">scdecd_c</a>
   must also use the SCLK kernel file. Note, however, that you only have to
   load the SCLK kernel file once in your program, no matter how many calls
   to <a href="../cspice/scencd_c.html">scencd_c</a> and <a href="../cspice/scdecd_c.html">scdecd_c</a> are made afterwards. See the KERNEL required
   reading file, <a href="../req/kernel.html">kernel.req</a>, for information about ``loading''
   miscellaneous kernel files into the kernel pool.
<P>
 
   <a href="../cspice/scdecd_c.html">scdecd_c</a> always returns a clock string prefixed by a partition number
   and the '/' character, for example
<P>
 
<PRE>
   2/2000:83:12
</PRE>
   If you want to read partition start and stop times for yourself, use the
   function <a href="../cspice/scpart_c.html">scpart_c</a>:

<H2> SCLK Conversion Functions
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   In order to correlate data obtained from different components of the
   CSPICE system, for example pointing and ephemeris data, it is necessary
   to be able to convert between SCLK time and representations of time in
   other systems, such as UTC and ephemeris time (also referred to as
   ``ET,'' ``barycentric dynamical time,'' and ``TDB'').
<P>

   The algorithms used to encode and decode SCLK, and convert between SCLK

<P>
 
   The differences are handled by the SCLK software at two levels:

<A NAME="Clock Types"></A>

<H3> Clock Types
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   A clock type is a general clock description that may encompass several
   separate spacecraft clocks. Each clock type is identified in the SCLK
   functions by an integer code. At the release date of the current
   revision of this document, all supported missions use spacecraft clock
   type 1.
<P>
 
   A spacecraft clock data type has two components: a format defining the
   set of acceptable spacecraft clock (SCLK) strings, and a method of
   converting SCLK strings to a standard time representation, such as
   ephemeris or UTC seconds past J2000.
<P>
 
   For example, a type 1 clock consists of some number of cascading integer
   counters. An individual counter can increment only when the immediately
   preceding counter reaches its maximum expression and ``rolls over.'' Our
   wall clock is an example: the counters are hours, minutes and seconds.
   One tick for a type 1 clock is defined to be the value of the
   least-significant component increment. Clock type 1 uses a
   piecewise-linear interpolation process to convert between SCLK and other
   time systems.
<P>
 
   The chapter ``SLCK01'' describes clock type 1 in detail. It includes the
   specific SCLK string formats for each of the type 1 spacecraft clocks
   supported by the CSPICE Toolkit.
<P>
 
   SCLK functions determine the clock type for a particular spacecraft from
   the SCLK kernel file (described in the next section).

   Each clock type is supported in the encoding and decoding process by the

<P>
 
<B>sctkcc_</B>    (sc, clkstr, ticks, len_clkstr )   (SCLK string to ticks,

   sctkcc_ and scfmcc_ do not process any partition information; that work

   Once the clock type has been determined, SCLK functions need parameters
   that uniquely distinguish each spacecraft within the same SCLK type. For
   instance, for type 1, they need to know: How many components make up
   this particular clock? What are the modulus values for each of the
   components? What are the coefficients defining the mapping from SCLK to
   a ``parallel'' time system, such as ET? Spacecraft-specific parameters
   such as these are read from the SCLK kernel file at run-time (see
   below).
<P>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> The SCLK Kernel File
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   NAIF SCLK kernel files supply CSPICE SCLK conversion functions with
   information required to convert between SCLK values and other
   representations of time. Typically, a NAIF SCLK kernel will describe the
   clock of a single spacecraft.
<P>
 
   Before calling any of the functions to encode or decode SCLK, or convert
   between SCLK and other time systems, an application program must load
   the contents of the SCLK kernel file into the kernel pool, using the
   function <a href="../cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> (load pool):
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> ( "name_of_SCLK_kernel_file" );
</PRE>
   An application must also load the leapseconds kernel file if there are
   any conversions to be performed between ET and UTC. This is typically
   done in the initialization section of your program.
<P>
 
   The SCLK kernel file you use should contain values for the particular
   spacecraft you are dealing with. The variables expected to be found in
   the file are all prefixed with the string
<P>

   These variables include partition boundaries, clock type, and several
   other parameters associated with the clock type. These are described

   containing one element per partition. The nth element of
<P>
 
<PRE>
   SCLK_PARTITITION_END_ss

   where cc is the clock type. New clock types will be developed as needed.
<P>
 
   Note that multiple spacecraft ID codes can be associated with the type 1
   SCLK data type at one time. Since the spacecraft codes are included in
   the SCLK variable names, there will be no naming conflicts. (We don't

   Accommodating new spacecraft clocks may involve no code changes to the
   SCLK subroutines whatsoever.
<P>
 
   If a new clock fits into the framework of clock type 1, then the clock
   can be accommodated simply by producing a new kernel file for that
   spacecraft clock. For the new clock, a new set of kernel variables
   corresponding to those described above, and those in the chapter
   ``SCLK01,'' could be added to an existing SCLK kernel file.
   Alternatively, an entirely new SCLK kernel file containing the new
   parameters could be created --- this is the more likely approach. Once
   this is done, all existing SCLK functions will function, without
   modification, using the spacecraft ID.
<P>
 
   If a new clock does not fit into the clock type 1 framework, then NAIF
   will design a new clock type. This will involve writing new versions of
   the four clock type-specific functions described earlier:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   sctkcc_
   scfmcc_
   sctecc_
   sceccc_
</PRE>
   where cc is the new clock type number.
<P>
 
   New cases will have to be added to the code of the following
   higher-level SCxxx conversion functions to call the new, type-specific
   functions:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/scfmt_c.html">scfmt_c</a>

   <a href="../cspice/sce2t_c.html">sce2t_c</a>
   <a href="../cspice/sce2s_c.html">sce2s_c</a>
</PRE>
   It will probably be necessary to design new SCLK kernel file variables
   to accommodate the new type, and augment the standard variables
   described above.
<P>
 
   Adding a new clock type does not change the calling sequence of any of
   the high-level conversion functions. Thus, once you've learned how to
   use the SCLK conversion functions, you won't have to re-learn just
   because a new spacecraft clock has been introduced.

   The following example shows how some of the SCLK functions might be used

   external source, such as a file or through interactive user input.

<H2> Type 1 SCLK format
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The first standard NAIF spacecraft clock data type has two components: a
   format defining the set of acceptable spacecraft clock (SCLK) strings,
   and a method of converting SCLK strings to any of a set of standard time
   systems such as TDT or TDB.
<P>
 
   Type 1 SCLK strings have the form
<P>
 
<PRE>
   pppp/&lt;time string&gt;
</PRE>
   where pppp is a partition number between 1 and 9999 inclusive, and
<P>
 
<PRE>
   &lt;time string&gt;
</PRE>
   is a time representation that conforms to the type 1 SCLK format. The
   partition specification (number and slash character) is optional; SCLK
   strings without partition numbers are assumed to refer to times in the
   first partition in which the specified clock count occurred. It's good
   practice to always include the partition number.
<P>
 
   An example of a type 1 SCLK string (for Galileo) is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   3 / 10110007:09:6:1
</PRE>
   The number ``3'' is the partition number, the slash is a delimiter, and
   the rest of the string is a ``time string.'' With this example in hand,
   we're ready to define the type 1 SCLK format.
<P>
 
   The partition number is a positive integer followed by a forward slash,
   for example
<P>
 
<PRE>
   4 /
</PRE>
   Zero or more blanks are allowed on either side of the slash.
<P>
 
   A type 1 SCLK time string consists of a series of one or more fields,
   each of which contains an integer. All fields but the leftmost are
   optional. The fields of a time string represent modular counts of time
   units. (A ``mod n'' count increments from zero to n-1, and then cycles
   back to zero.) The values for a given field may be offset by some fixed
   integer, so that they range from m to m+n, where m is non-negative. The
   moduli of the various fields are not necessarily the same. The time unit
   associated with a given field, multiplied by the modulus for that field,
   gives the time unit for next field to the left.
<P>
 
   For each field but the first, values may exceed the modulus for the
   field. For example, the modulus of the fourth field of a Galileo SCLK
   string is 8, but the digit ``9'' is allowed in that field. So
<P>
 
<PRE>
   0:0:0:9
</PRE>
   is a valid Galileo SCLK string and represents the same time as
<P>
 
<PRE>
   0:0:1:1
</PRE>
   On input to CSPICE functions, the fields of a type 1 SCLK string may be
   separated by any of the delimiter characters
<P>
 
<PRE>
   -  .  ,  :  &lt;blank&gt;
</PRE>
   Consecutive non-blank delimiters containing no intervening digits are
   treated as if they delimit zero values, consecutive blanks are treated
   as a single blank, while blanks preceding or following a non-blank
   delimiter are ignored, as illustrated by this list of eqivalent Galileo
   SCLK strings:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   00000001:00:3:4
   1:0:3:4
   1::3:4
   1 0 3 4
   1  0   3    4
   1 : 0   3  :  4
   1 : : 3 : 4
</PRE>
   On output from CSPICE functions, the delimiter characters will be those
   defined by a parameter in the SCLK kernel, described later.
<P>
 
   Note that all fields in time strings represent integers, not decimal
   fractions. So, the strings
<P>
 
<PRE>
   11000687:9
 
   11000687:90
</PRE>
   do not represent the same time value: in the former, the second field
   indicates a count of 9; in the latter, 90.

<H2> Type 1 SCLK conversion
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   CSPICE contains functions that convert between type 1 clock strings and
   the following representations of time:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> ET (TDB)
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> encoded SCLK
<BR><BR></UL>
   The functions that carry out these conversions are described above in
   the chapter ``SCLK Conversion Functions.''
<P>
 
   Since CSPICE also contains functions that convert between any of a
   variety of standard time systems, including ET, UTC, Terrestrial
   Dynamical Time (TDT), TAI, TDB Julian date, TDT Julian Date, and UTC
   Julian Date, conversion between SCLK strings and any other time system
   supported by CSPICE requires at most two function calls.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Conversion algorithms"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Conversion algorithms
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   For every type 1 spacecraft clock, encoded SCLK values are converted to
   ephemeris time (TDB) as follows: first, encoded SCLK values are mapped
   to equivalent time values in a standard time system such as TDB or TDT.
   If the standard time system is not TDB, values from this system are
   mapped to TDB.
<P>
 
   The standard time system used for the conversion is referred to here and
   in the CSPICE SCLK functions as the ``parallel'' time system. Normally,
   the CSPICE Toolkit will use only one parallel time system for any given
   spacecraft clock.
<P>
 
   Conversion from TDB to encoded SCLK follows the reverse path: first, TDB
   values are converted, if necessary, to equivalent values in the parallel
   time system; next, those parallel time values are converted to encoded
   SCLK.
<P>
 
   For each type 1 spacecraft clock, encoded SCLK is related to the
   parallel time system for that clock by a piecewise linear function. The
   function is defined by a set of pairs of encoded SCLK values and
   corresponding values in the parallel time system, and by a set of
   ``rate'' values that apply to the intervals between the pairs of time
   values. The rate values give the rate at which ``parallel time''
   increases with respect to encoded SCLK time during the interval over
   which the rate applies. The rates in a type 1 SCLK kernel have units of
<P>
 
<PRE>
    parallel time system units
   ----------------------------
   most significant clock count
</PRE>
   The units of the currently supported parallel time systems TDT and TDB
   are seconds measured in those respective systems. So clock rates may be
   TDT or TDB seconds per most significant clock count. For example, for
   the GLL orbiter spacecraft clock, the rate unit is ``TDB seconds per
   RIM.''
<P>
 
   The specific method by which pairs of time values and rates are used to
   map encoded SCLK to parallel time values is explained in detail below.
   In the following discussion we'll use the name ``PARSYS'' to refer to
   the parallel time system. We'll use the name MSF to indicate the number
   of ticks per most significant SCLK field.
<P>
 
   We can represent the data that define the SCLK-to-PARSYS mapping as a
   set of ordered triples of encoded SCLK values (in units of ticks since
   spacecraft clock start), their equivalents in PARSYS time, and the rates
   corresponding to each pair of times:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   ( s/c_clock(1),  parsys(1),  rate(1) )
                     .
                     .
                     .
   ( s/c_clock(n),  parsys(n),  rate(n) )
</PRE>
   The mapping of SCLK values to PARSYS times is carried out as follows: If
   the sclk time ``clock'' satisfies
<P>
 
<PRE>
   sclk(i)  &lt;  clock  &lt;  sclk(i+1)
            -
</PRE>
   then the corresponding PARSYS time is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   parsys(i)  +    ( rate(i)/MSF )  *  ( clock - sclk(i) )
</PRE>
   If
<P>
 
<PRE>
   clock  &gt;  clock(n)
          -
</PRE>
   the formula still applies, with i = n.
<P>
 
   To convert PARSYS time values to SCLK, we use an analogous method. If
   ``time'' is the value to be converted, and
<P>
 
<PRE>
   parsys(i)  &lt;  time  &lt;  parsys(i+1)
              _
</PRE>
   then the corresponding continuous encoded SCLK value is
<P>
 
<PRE>
                   time -  parsys(i)
   sclk(i)    +    ----------------
                     rate(i)/MSF
</PRE>
   If
<P>
 
<PRE>
   time &gt;  parsys(n)
        -
</PRE>
   the formula still applies, with i = n.
<P>
 
   Note that this method will not handle rate values of 0 parallel time
   system units per tick.
<P>
 
   When the function described by the pairs of time values and rates is
   continuous, then all rates except for the last one are redundant, since
<P>
 
<PRE>
                    parsys(i+1) -  parsys(i)
   rate(i)/MSF  =   ------------------------
                     sclk(i+1)  -   sclk(i)
</PRE>
   If the mapping from encoded SCLK to the parallel time system is not
   continuous, then the mapping will not be strictly invertible: if an
   encoded SCLK value is mapped to a parallel time value, then mapping that
   parallel time value to encoded SCLK may not yield the original encoded
   SCLK value. However, the capability of supporting non-continuous
   mappings is provided in case it is needed to implement the mapping
   provided by a flight project.
<P>
 
   In order for CSPICE SCLK conversion functions to work, the information
   represented by the ordered triples described above must be loaded via
   the kernel pool. See the section ``The spacecraft clock kernel file''
   below for details.

   Before any CSPICE functions that make use of type 1 SCLK values can be

   The time coefficients are assigned to the variable
<P>
 
<PRE>
   SCLK01_COEFFICIENTS_ss

   where --ss is the spacecraft ID code. The assigned values are triplets
   of SCLK values, corresponding parallel time values, and rates. The SCLK
   values are expressed in total ticks since clock start. The parallel time
   values may be expressed in a variety of units. The rate values have
   units that depend on the units used for the parallel time values: if we
   call these units

   most significant clock count
</PRE>
   The term most ``significant clock count'' shown in the denominator
   refers to the length of time associated with one count of the most
   significant (leftmost) field of the formatted spacecraft clock string.
   For example, for Voyager 2, the most significant field of a formatted
   SCLK string is the ``mod 16'' field. For Galileo, the most significant
   field is the ``RIM count.'' For Mars Global Surveyor, the most
   significant field is the ``sclk_secs count.''

   Status
   -----------------------------------------------
 
      This file is a SPICE spacecraft clock (SCLK) kernel containing
      information required for Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft
      on-board clock to ET conversion.
 
 
   Production/History of this SCLK files
   -----------------------------------------------
 
      This file was generated by the NAIF utility program MAKCLK,
      version 3.3, from the most recent Mars Global Surveyor
      spacecraft SCLK SCET file.
 
 
   Usage
   -----------------------------------------------
 
      This file must be loaded into the user's program by a call to
      the FURNSH subroutine
 
            CALL FURNSH( 'this_file_name' )
 
      in order to use the SPICELIB SCLK family of subroutines to
      convert MGS spacecraft on-board clock to ET and vice versa and
      to use MGS frames defined below as reference frames for
      geometric quantities being returned by high-level SPK and
      CK subroutines.

   The document differs from the previous version of April 20, 1992 in that
   it documents the new capability of the SCLK software to convert between
   ET and continuous ticks. Examples involving Mars Observer have been
   updated to refer to Mars Global Surveyor. The quotation style has been
   changed from British to American. The program example showing use of the
   SCLK system together with the CK reader CKGP has been corrected.
   Miscellaneous minor changes of wording have been made throughout the
   text.
