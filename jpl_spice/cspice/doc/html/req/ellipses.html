   CSPICE contains a substantial set of subroutines that solve common
   mathematical problems involving ellipses and triaxial ellipsoids. This
   required reading file documents those routines, gives examples of their
   use, and presents some of the mathematical background required to
   understand the routines.

<A NAME="Introduction"></A>

<H3> Introduction
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The `ellipse' is a structured data type used in CSPICE to represent
   ellipses in three-dimensional space. SPICE ellipses exist to simplify
   calling sequences of routines that output or accept as input data that
   defines ellipses.
<P>
 
   Ellipses turn up frequently in the sort of science analysis problems
   CSPICE is designed to help solve. The shapes of extended
   bodies--planets, satellites, and the Sun--are frequently modeled by
   triaxial ellipsoids. The IAU has defined such models for the Sun, all of
   the planets, and most of their satellites, in the IAU/IAG/COSPAR working
   group report [1]. Many geometry problems involving triaxial ellipsoids
   give rise to ellipses as `mathematical byproducts'. Ellipses are also
   used in modeling orbits and planetary rings.

<H2> Ellipse Data Type Description
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The following representation of an ellipse is used throughout SPICE, and
   in particular by the ellipse access routines: An ellipse is the set of
   points
<P>
 
<PRE>
   ellipse = CENTER    +    cos(theta) * V1    +    sin(theta) * V2
</PRE>
   where CENTER, V1, and V2 are 3-vectors, and theta is in the range
<P>
 
<PRE>
   (-pi, pi].
</PRE>
   The set of points "ellipse" is an ellipse (see Appendix A: Mathematical
   notes). The ellipse defined by this parametric representation is
   non-degenerate if and only if V1 and V2 are linearly independent.
<P>
 
   We call CENTER the `center' of the ellipse, and we refer to V1 and V2 as
   `generating vectors'. Note that an ellipse centered at the coordinate
   origin (0, 0, 0,) is completely specified by its generating vectors.
   Further mention of the center or generating vectors for a particular
   ellipse, means vectors that play the role of CENTER or V1 and V2 in
   defining that ellipse.
<P>
 
   This representation of ellipses has the particularly convenient property
   that it allows easy computation of the image of an ellipse under a
   linear transformation. If M is a matrix representing a linear
   transformation, and E is the ellipse
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CENTER    +    cos(theta) * V1    +    sin(theta) * V2,
</PRE>
   then the image of E under the transformation represented by M is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   M*CENTER    +    cos(theta) * M*V1    +    sin(theta) * M*V2.
</PRE>
   If we accept that the first set of points is an ellipse, then we can see
   that the image of an ellipse under a linear transformation is always
   another (possibly degenerate) ellipse.
<P>
 
   Since many geometric computations involving ellipses and ellipsoids may
   be greatly simplified by judicious application of linear transformations
   to ellipses, it is useful to have a representation for ellipses that
   allows ready computation of their images under such mappings.
<P>
 
   The internal design of the ellipse data type is not part of its
   specification. The design is an implementation choice based on the
   programming language and so the design may change. Users should not
   write code based on the current implementation; such code might fail
   when used with a future version of CSPICE.
<P>
 
   NAIF implemented the SPICE ellipse data type in C as a structure with
   the fields
<P>
 
<PRE>
      SpiceDouble      center    [3];
      SpiceDouble      semiMajor [3];
      SpiceDouble      semiMinor [3];
</PRE>
   The fields are set and accessed by a small set of access routines
   provided for that purpose. Do not access the fields in any other way.
<P>
 
   The elements of SPICE ellipses are set using <a href="../cspice/cgv2el_c.html">cgv2el_c</a> (center and
   generating vectors to ellipse) and accessed using <a href="../cspice/el2cgv_c.html">el2cgv_c</a> (ellipse to
   center and generating vectors).

<H3> Constructing ellipses
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Let `center', `v1', and `v2' be a center vector and two generating
   vectors for an ellipse.
<P>
 
   Let `center', `v1', `v2', and `ellips' be declared by:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   SpiceEllipse         ellips;
   SpiceDouble          center [3];
   SpiceDouble          v1     [3];
   SpiceDouble          v2     [3];
</PRE>
   After `center', `v1', and `v2' have been assigned values, you can
   construct a SPICE ellipse using <a href="../cspice/cgv2el_c.html">cgv2el_c</a>:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/cgv2el_c.html">cgv2el_c</a> ( center, v1, v2,  &amp;ellips );
</PRE>
   This call produces the SPICE ellipse `ellips', which represents the same
   mathematical ellipse as do `center', `v1', and `v2'.
<P>
 
   The generating vectors need not be linearly independent. If they are
   not, the resulting ellipse will be degenerate. Specifically, if the
   generating vectors are both zero, the ellipse will be the single point
   represented by `center', and if just one of the semi-axis vectors (call
   it V) is non-zero, the ellipse will be the line segment extending from
<P>

   CENTER - V

   to

   CENTER + V

   Let `ellips' be a SPICE ellipse. To produce the center and two
   generating vectors for `ellips', we can make the call
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/el2cgv_c.html">el2cgv_c</a> ( &amp;ellips, center, v1, v2 );
</PRE>
   On output, `v1' will be a semi-major axis vector for the ellipse
   represented by `ellips', and `v2' will be a semi-minor axis vector.
   Semi-axis vectors are never unique; if X is a semi-axis vector; then so
   is -X.
<P>
 
   `v1' is a vector of maximum norm extending from the ellipse's center to
   the ellipse itself; `v2' is an analogous vector of minimum norm. `v1'
   and V2 are orthogonal vectors.
<P>

</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Because the routine <a href="../cspice/el2cgv_c.html">el2cgv_c</a> always returns semi-axes as generating
   vectors, if `v1' and `v2' are not semi-axes on input to <a href="../cspice/cgv2el_c.html">cgv2el_c</a>, the
   sequence of calls

</PRE>
   will certainly modify `v1' and `v2'. Even if `v1' and `v2' are semi-axes
   to start out with, because of the non-uniqueness of semi-axes, one or
   both of these vectors could be negated on output from <a href="../cspice/el2cgv_c.html">el2cgv_c</a>.
<P>
 
   There is a sense in which <a href="../cspice/cgv2el_c.html">cgv2el_c</a> and <a href="../cspice/el2cgv_c.html">el2cgv_c</a> are inverses, though:
   the above sequence of calls returns a center and generating vectors that

   where CENTER, V1, and V2 are specified vectors in three-dimensional

   fact an ellipse as we've claimed.

   Since the vector CENTER simply translates the set, we may assume without
   loss of generality that it is the zero vector. So we'll re-write our

<P>
 
<PRE>
   cos(theta) * V1    +    sin(theta) * V2

   where theta is a real number in the interval (-pi, pi]. We'll give the

   assume that V1 and V2 lie in the x-y plane. Therefore, we can treat V1
   and V2 as two-dimensional vectors.
<P>
 
   If V1 and V2 are linearly dependent, S is a line segment or a point, so
   there is nothing to prove. We'll assume from now on that V1 and V2 are

   We can find a new orthogonal basis such that this equation transforms to

   since SYM is symmetric, there exists an orthogonal matrix M that
   diagonalizes SYM. That is, we can find an orthogonal matrix M such that

</PRE>
   The existence of such a matrix M will not be proved here; see reference
   [2]. The columns of M are the elements of the basis we're looking for:

   then our equation in x and y transforms to the equation

   This last equation is that of an ellipse, as long as d1 and d2 are
   positive. To verify that they are, note that d1 and d2 are the
   eigenvalues of the matrix SYM, and SYM is the product
<P>
 
<PRE>
      -1  T   -1
   ( C   )   C,
</PRE>
   which is of the form
<P>
 
<PRE>
    T
   M   M,
</PRE>
   so SYM is positive semi-definite (its eigenvalues are non-negative).
   Furthermore, since the product
<P>
 
<PRE>
      -1  T   -1
   ( C   )   C
</PRE>
   is non-singular if C is non-singular, and since the columns of C are V1
   and V2, SYM exists and is non-singular precisely when V1 and V2 are
   linearly independent, a condition that we have assumed. So the
   eigenvalues of SYM can't be zero. They're not negative either. We
   conclude they're positive.

<H2> Solving intersection problems
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   There is one problem solving technique used in SPICE ellipse and
   ellipsoid routines that is so useful that it deserves special mention:
   using a `distortion map' to solve intersection problems.
<P>
 
   The distortion map (as it is referred to in CSPICE routines) is simply a
   linear transformation that maps an ellipsoid to the unit sphere. The
   distortion map defined by an ellipsoid whose semi-axes are A, B, and C
   is represented by the matrix
<P>
 
<PRE>
   +-                -+
   |  1/A   0    0    |
   |   0   1/B   0    |.
   |   0    0    1/C  |
   +-                -+
</PRE>
   The distortion map is (as is clear from examining the matrix) one-to-one
   and onto, and in particular is invertible, so it preserves set
   operations such as intersection. That is, if M is a distortion map and
   X, Y are two sets, then
<P>
 
<PRE>
   M( X intersect Y ) = M(X) intersect M(Y).
</PRE>
   The same is true of the inverse of the distortion map.
<P>
 
   The utility of these facts is that frequently it's easier to find the
   intersection of the images under the distortion map of two sets than it
   is to find the intersection of the original two sets. Having found the
   intersection of the `distorted' sets, we apply the inverse distortion
   map to arrive at the intersection of the original sets. Some examples:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> To find the intersection of a ray and an ellipsoid, apply the distortion
map to both. Because the distortion map is linear, the ray maps to another
ray, and the ellipsoid maps to the unit sphere. The resulting intersection
problem is easy to solve. Having found the points of intersection of the
new ray and the unit sphere, if any, we apply the inverse distortion map to
these points, and we're done.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> To find the intersection of a plane and an ellipsoid, apply the distortion
map to both. The linearity of the distortion map ensures that the original
plane maps to a second plane (whose formula is easily calculated). The
ellipsoid maps to the unit sphere. The intersection of a plane and a unit
sphere is easily found. The inverse distortion map is then applied to the
circle of intersection (when the intersection is non-trivial), and the
ellipse of intersection of the original plane and ellipsoid results. This
procedure is used in the CSPICE routine <a href="../cspice/inedpl_c.html">inedpl_c</a>.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> To find the image under gnomonic projection onto a plane (camera
projection) of an ellipsoid, given a focal point, we must find the
intersection of the plane and the cone generated by ellipsoid and the focal
point. Applying the distortion map to the ellipsoid, plane, and focal
point, the problem is transformed into that of finding the intersection of
the transformed plane with the cone generated by a unit sphere and the
transformed focal point. This `transformed' problem is much easier to
solve. The resulting intersection ellipse is then mapped back to the
original intersection ellipse by the inverse distortion mapping.

   Corrections were made to comments in the code example that computes the
   altitude of a ray above the limb of an ellipsoid. Previously, the
   quantity computed was incorrectly described as the altitude of a ray
   above an ellipsoid.
