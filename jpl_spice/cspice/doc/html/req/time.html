<H2> Introduction
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   This document describes the software available in the CSPICE Toolkit for
   manipulating various representations of time. It is your main source for
   general information about calendar based and continuous time systems in
   SPICE. For specifics of a particular function you should consult the
   header of that function.
<P>
 
   The Toolkit also supports conversion between spacecraft clock (SCLK) and
   Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). CSPICE functions dealing with
   spacecraft clock are discussed in SCLK Required Reading (<a href="../req/sclk.html">sclk.req</a>).

<H3> International Atomic Time (TAI)
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Before discussing Coordinated Universal Time we feel it is helpful to
   talk about International Atomic Time (TAI or atomic time). Atomic time
   is based upon the atomic second as defined by the ``oscillation of the
   undisturbed cesium atom.'' Atomic time is simply a count of atomic
   seconds that have occurred since the astronomically determined instant
   of midnight January 1, 1958 00:00:00 at the Royal Observatory in
   Greenwich, England. Atomic time is kept by the International Earth
   Rotation Service (IERS, formally the Bureau International L'Heure---BIH)
   in Paris, France. The National Bureau of Standards and the U.S. Naval
   Observatory set their clocks by the clock maintained by the IERS.

<A NAME="Naming the seconds of TAI --- UTC"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Naming the seconds of TAI --- UTC
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Coordinated Universal Time is a method of time keeping that gives a name
   to each instant of time of the TAI system. These names are formed from
   the calendar date and time of day that we use in our daily affairs. They
   consist of 6 components: year, month, day, hour, minutes and seconds.
   The year, month and day components are the normal calendar year month
   and day that appear on wall calendars. The hours component may assume
   any value from 0 through 23. The minutes component may assume any value
   from 0 to 59. The seconds will usually (but not always) range from 0 to
   59.999... . The hour-minute-second string
<P>
 
<PRE>
   00:00:00
</PRE>
   is midnight and is the first instant of the calendar day specified by
   the first three components of the UTC time.
<P>
 
   In the SPICE system UTC times are represented by character strings.
   These strings contain: year, month, day, hour, minute and second
   separated by delimiters (spaces or punctuation marks). The various
   delimiters and substrings between the delimiters are called the tokens
   of the string. A typical time string looks like
<P>
 
<PRE>
   5 OCTOBER 1986 7:20:16.122 (UTC)
</PRE>
   The tokens of the string and the associated UTC time components are
<P>
 
<PRE>
   5       --- day
   OCTOBER --- month
   1986    --- year
   7       --- hours
   20      --- minutes
   16.122  --- seconds
</PRE>
   The link between any token and its corresponding UTC component is
   determined by examining the values of the tokens and comparing them to
   the other tokens. The precise rules used are spelled out in great detail
   in Appendix C. For now, simply be assured that the following five
   strings all mean the same thing and are interpreted in the same way by
   SPICE.

<H3> Tying UTC to the Earth's Rotation
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The names given to TAI instants by the UTC system are governed by the
   earth's rotation. Ideally, UTC strings having hours, minutes and seconds
   components all zero should correspond to Greenwich midnight as
   determined by the observations of the transits of stars (the time system
   known as UT1). However, since the rotation of the earth is not uniform,
   this ideal cannot be realized. The difference between Greenwich midnight
   observed astronomically and UTC midnight is almost never zero. However,
   to keep the difference from becoming too large, UTC is occasionally
   adjusted so that the difference between the two midnights never exceeds
   .9 seconds. Thus from a knowledge of UTC one can always compute UT1 to
   better than 1 second accuracy.

<H3> Leapseconds
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   When Greenwich UT1 midnight lags behind UTC midnight by more than 0.9
   seconds the International Earth Rotation Service will announce that a
   leap second will be added to the collection of UTC names. This leap
   second has traditionally been added after the last ``normal'' UTC name
   of December 31 or June 30. Thus when a UTC second is added the
   hours-minutes-seconds portion of the UTC name progresses as shown here

   Should Greenwich UT1 midnight run ahead of UTC midnight by more than 0.9
   seconds the IERS will announce a negative leap second. In this case one
   of the usual UTC hours-minutes-seconds triples will be missing from the
   list of UTC names. In this case the progression will be:

   Since 1972 when leap seconds and the UTC system were introduced, a
   negative leap second has not occurred.
<P>
 
   Leapseconds occur at the same time in all time zones. In other words,
   the seconds component of a time string is the same for any time zone as
   is the seconds component of UTC. The following are all legitimate ways
   to represent an epoch of some event that occurred in the leapsecond

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> The Leapseconds Kernel (LSK)
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The primary difficulty with UTC strings is that it is not possible to
   predict which atomic times will correspond to times during a UTC leap
   second. Thus algorithms for converting between UTC and time systems that
   simply use a continuous set of numeric markers require knowledge of the
   location of leap seconds in the list of names. This is the purpose of
   the Leapseconds Kernel (LSK). To convert between UTC times and any other
   system, you must first load the Leapseconds Kernel via a call to the
   function <a href="../cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.
<P>
 
   LSK files conform to a flexible format called ``NAIF text kernel''
   format. The SPICE file identification word provided by itself on the
   first line of an LSK file is ``KPL/LSK''. Both the NAIF text kernel
   format and SPICE file identification word are described in detail in the
   Kernel Required Reading document, <a href="../req/kernel.html">kernel.req</a>.
<P>
 
   When the IERS announces a new leapsecond will be declared in the future,
   NAIF makes available an updated Leapseconds Lernel several months prior
   to the new leapsecond taking effect and announces its availability to
   the SPICE user community.

<H2> Barycentric Dynamic Time (TDB)
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   TDB is the uniform time scale represented by the independent variable in
   the differential equations that describe the motions of the planets, sun
   and moon. There are two forms of ephemeris time: Barycentric Dynamical
   Time (TDB) and Terrestrial Time (TT). These time systems are closely
   related, as described below.

<A NAME="The J2000 Epoch"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> The J2000 Epoch
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The basic spatial reference system for SPICE is the J2000 system. This
   is an inertial reference frame in which the equations of motion for the
   solar system may be integrated. This reference frame is specified by the
   orientation of the earth's mean equator and equinox at a particular
   epoch --- the J2000 epoch. This epoch is Greenwich noon on January 1,
   2000 Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). Throughout the SPICE
   documentation you will see the expressions: ``seconds past 2000'';
   ``seconds past J2000''; or ``seconds past the J2000 epoch.'' In all
   cases, the reference epoch is noon January 1, 2000 on a particular time
   scale.
<P>
 
   (As we've seen, ``J2000'' is used to name the fundamental inertial frame
   as well as a particular epoch. This can sometimes be confusing if you
   are not careful to distinguish the context in which the term ``J2000''
   is used.)

<H3> Terrestrial Time (TT)

   Terrestrial Time is used when describing motions of objects near the

<H3> The Relationship between TT and TDB
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   TDB is believed to be in agreement with the time that would be kept by
   an atomic clock located at the solar system barycenter (SSB). A
   comparison of the times kept by a clock at the solar system barycenter
   with a TDB clock on earth would reveal that the two clocks are in close
   agreement but that they run at different rates at different times of the
   year. This is due to relativistic effects.
<P>
 
   At some times in the year the TT clock appears to run fast when compared
   to the TDB clock, at other times of the year it appears to run slow. Let
   TDB0 be some fixed epoch on the TDB clock and TT0 be a fixed epoch on
   the TT clock (TDB0 and TT0 do not necessarily have to be the same
   epoch). Any epoch, EPOCH, can be represented in the following ways: as
   the number of seconds TDB(EPOCH), that have elapsed since TDB0 on the
   TDB clock; or as the number of seconds, TT(EPOCH), that have elapsed
   since TT0 on the TT clock. If we plot the differences TDB(EPOCH) -
   TT(EPOCH) against TDB(EPOCH) over all epochs, we will find that the
   graph is very close to a periodic function.
<P>
 
   In SPICE the difference between TT and TDB is computed as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
         TDB - TT =  K * sin (E)                  (1)
</PRE>
   where K is a constant, and E is the eccentric anomaly of the
   heliocentric orbit of the Earth-Moon barycenter. This difference, which
   ignores small-period fluctuations, is accurate to about 0.000030
   seconds. To five decimal places the difference between TT and TDB is a
   periodic function with magnitude approximately 0.001658 seconds and
   period equal to one sidereal year.
<P>
 
   The eccentric anomaly E is given by
<P>
 
<PRE>
        E = M + EB sin (M)                         (2)
</PRE>
   where EB and M are the eccentricity and mean anomaly of the heliocentric
   orbit of the Earth-Moon barycenter. The mean anomaly is in turn given by
<P>
 
<PRE>
        M = M0 + M1*t                              (3)
</PRE>
   where t is the epoch TDB expressed in barycentric dynamical seconds past
   the epoch of J2000.
<P>
 
   The values K, EB, M0, and M1 are retrieved from the kernel pool. These
   are part of the Leapseconds Kernel. They correspond to the ``kernel pool
   variables'' DELTET/K, DELTET/EB, and DELTET/M. The nominal values are:

   Although TDB is a formal time, within the limits of measurements it
   coincides with atomic time. As such we should be able to relate it to
   the expressions of time that we use everyday.
<P>
 
   However, ephemeris time is described as a count of ephemeris seconds
   past the ephemeris reference epoch (J2000). For most of us the
   expression
<P>
 
<PRE>
   -312819349 seconds past the ephemeris epoch J2000
</PRE>
   bears little relationship to the time system we use to organize our
   lives. For this reason, it is common to give names to the various
   ephemeris seconds in a manner analogous to the UTC naming of the seconds
   of TAI---as a calendar date and time of day. The above string
   corresponds to
<P>
 
<PRE>
   1990 FEB 1 21:44:11 (TDB)
</PRE>
   There is an important distinction between the names given to ephemeris
   seconds and the names used by the UTC system. The names assigned to
   ephemeris times never have leap seconds. The `seconds' component of the
   name is restricted to and includes all values from 0 to 59.999... . Thus
   the time string above does not represent the same moment in time as does
   ``1990 FEB 1 21:44:11 (UTC)'' There are two reasons. First, ephemeris
   time is ahead of atomic time by 32.184 seconds. Second, when a leap
   second occurs, UTC strings fit an extra name into the sequence of valid
   UTC names. Thus it appears that UTC names fall behind TDB names by a
   second after each leapsecond. For instance, as of 2020 DEC 01 UTC time
   strings appear to be 69.184 seconds behind TDB time strings. This
   difference is due to the fact that the two naming conventions are not
   the same; they simply have a lot of names in common.
<P>
 
   It is both fortunate and unfortunate that there is a huge set of common
   names between calendar dates TDB and calendar dates UTC. Since there are
   relatively few leapseconds, a time given by an TDB name is always close
   to the time in the UTC system having the same name. Thus for planning
   whether or not you are likely to need a coat and how to arrange your
   daily activities around the observation. But for precise work you must
   pay attention to the difference between the two time systems. If in
   planning the observation of a stellar occultation by an asteroid the
   difference between the two naming systems is neglected, it is likely
   that the observation will be missed.

   There is no way of predicting when future leapseconds will occur. The
   IERS announces the addition of a new leapsecond several months in
   advance of its effective date. But beyond this, predictions of
   leapseconds are not reliable. As a result we cannot say with certainty
   when a particular future UTC epoch will occur. For example, suppose you
   have a timer that you can set to ``beep'' after some number of seconds
   have passed. If this timer counts seconds perfectly without loosing or
   gaining time over decades, you cannot set it today to beep at midnight
   (00:00:00) January 1 (UTC) ten years from now---the number of
   leapseconds that will have occurred in the next ten years is not known.
   On the other hand, it is possible to set the timer so that it will beep
   at midnight January 1 (TDB) since the TDB system does not have
   leapseconds. It is only necessary to know an algorithm for converting
   calendar epochs TDB to seconds past some reference epoch in order to
   determine how to set the timer to beep at the correct epoch.
<P>
 
   Any given Leapseconds Kernel will eventually become obsolete. Sometime
   after the creation of any Leapseconds Kernel there will be a new
   leapsecond that must be accounted for.
<P>
 
   When future leapseconds occur the old Leapseconds Kernel will no longer
   correctly describe the relationship between UTC, TT and TDB for epochs
   that follow the new leapsecond. However, for epochs prior to the new
   leapsecond, the old kernel will always correctly describe the
   relationship between UTC, TT and TDB.
<P>
 
   NAIF announces the addition, or not, of a new leapsecond declared by the
   IERS several months in advance of it taking place. Simultaneously NAIF
   prepares and announces a new Leapseconds Kernel if one is needed.

</PRE>
   At least in October 1996, it's clear that if you have either TT or UTC
   you can construct the corresponding representation for the same epoch in
   the UTC or TT system by simply subtracting or adding 62.184 seconds.
<P>
 
   If you don't worry about what happens during a leapsecond you can
   express the above idea as:
<P>
 
<PRE>
        DeltaTT =  TT - UTC                      (4)
</PRE>
   For all epochs except during UTC leapseconds the above expression makes
   sense. DeltaTT is simply a step function, increasing by one after each
   leapsecond. Thus DeltaTT can be viewed as a step function of either UTC
   or TT.
<P>
 
   If you rearrange this expression, you can get
<P>
 
<PRE>
        UTC = TT - DeltaTT                       (5)
</PRE>
   Since, TT can be expressed as seconds past J2000 (TT), the above
   expression indicates that UTC can be expressed as some count of seconds.
   This representation is referred to by the dubious name of ``UTC seconds
   past J2000.'' If you write down the UTC calendar time string
   corresponding to an epoch and count the number of seconds between that
   calendar expression and the UTC calendar expression ``January 1, 2000
   12:00:00'' and ignore leapseconds, you get the value of UTC in the
   expression above.
<P>
 
   In practice this expression is broken down as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
        UTC  =  TT - DeltaTA - DeltaAT            (6)
</PRE>
   where
<P>
 
<PRE>
        DeltaTA =  (TT - TAI)
</PRE>
   and
<P>
 
<PRE>
        DeltaAT =  DeltaTT - DeltaTA
</PRE>
   The value DeltaTA is a constant, its value is nominally 32.184 seconds.
   DeltaTA is a step function. These two variables appear in the
   Leapseconds Kernel.
<P>
 
   If we combine equation (6) above with equation (1) from the section
   ``The Relationship between TT and TDB'' we get the following expression
<P>
 
<PRE>
        TDB - UTC =  DeltaTA + DeltaAT + K*sin(E)  (7)
</PRE>
   This last value is called DeltaET and is computed by the CSPICE function
   <a href="../cspice/deltet_c.html">deltet_c</a>. The various values that are used in the computation of DeltaET
   are contained in the Leapseconds Kernel. Below we show the principal

   As we pointed out above, the expression ( TT - UTC ) is meaningful as
   long as you stay away from leapseconds. If you write down the TT and UTC
   representations for an epoch that occurs during a leapsecond you will
   have something like this:

   Given these two epochs, it is no longer clear what we should assign to
   the value TT - UTC. Thus, although equation (7) above provides a simple
   expression for computing the ``difference between UTC and TDB'', the
   expression fails to tell us how to convert between TDB (or TT) and UTC
   during leapseconds. For this reason the SPICE system does not use
   DeltaET when converting between TDB (or TT) and UTC. Instead, the table
   of offsets corresponding to DeltaAT in the Leapseconds Kernel is
   converted to an equivalent table as shown below.

   The Julian date system is a numerical time system that allows you to

   The default interpretation of `string' is to regard the time of day to
   be a time on a 24-hour clock in the UTC time system. The date is a date
   on the Gregorian Calendar (this is the calendar used in nearly all
   Western societies).

   The variety of ways people have developed for representing times is
   enormous. It is unlikely that any single function can accommodate all of
   the custom time formats that have arisen in various computing contexts.
   However, we believe that <a href="../cspice/str2et_c.html">str2et_c</a> correctly interprets most time formats
   used throughout the planetary science community. For example <a href="../cspice/str2et_c.html">str2et_c</a>

   MS-DOS formats, epochs in both the A.D. and B.C. eras, time zones, etc.

<H3> Function to convert a TDB (ET) to Local True Solar Time
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Local solar time is used to give people an idea of how high the sun is
   in the sky as seen from a particular site on surface of a planet or
   satellite. When the Sun is on the zenith meridian, the local solar time
   is 12:00:00 noon. For points on the equator of a body, the Sun rises
   around 6:00:00 A.M. local solar time; it sets around 6:00:00 P.M. local
   solar time.
<P>
 
   Formally, the local solar time at a site on a body is the difference
   between the planetocentric longitude of the site and the planetocentric
   longitude of the Sun as seen from the center of the body. The angular
   difference in these two longitudes is measured in hours, minutes, and
   seconds in the same sense that hours, minutes and seconds are used to
   measure right ascension--- 24 hours in 360 degrees; 60 minutes in an
   hour; 60 seconds in a minute. When the sun is on the zenith meridian
   (directly overhead), the hour is defined to be 12. Finally, the hours
   increase from sunrise to sunset.
<P>
 
   Because of these conventions, an hour of local solar time will not be of
   the same duration as a UTC hour. In the case of a site on Mars, a solar
   hour will be approximately 62 UTC minutes.
<P>
 
   Local solar time for a specific site can be computed using the function:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/et2lst_c.html">et2lst_c</a> ( et, body, lon, type, timlen, ampmlen,
              hr, mn, sc, time, ampm );
</PRE>
   This function requires appropriate SPK and PCK data.
<P>
 
   This function converts ephemeris time (TDB) to the local solar time for
   a point at a user specified longitude on the surface of a body. This
   computation is performed using the bodyfixed location of the sun.
   Consequently, you must first load SPK and PCK files that contain
   sufficient position and orientation data for the computation of the
   bodyfixed location of the sun.
<P>
 
   Load SPK and PCKs (text and binary) using <a href="../cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   As with the Leapseconds Kernel, SPKs and PCKs need to be loaded just

 The default interpretation of a year that has been abbreviated to two
digits with or without a leading quote as in 'xy or xy (such as '92 or
92) is to treat the year as 19xy if xy &gt; 68 and to treat it as 20xy
otherwise. Thus '70 is interpreted as 1970 and '67 is treated as 2067.
However, you may change the "split point" and centuries through use of
the CSPICE function <a href="../cspice/tsetyr_c.html">tsetyr_c</a>. See that function for a discussion of how
you may reset the split point.<BR>

 All epochs are regarded as belonging to the Gregorian calendar. We
formally extend the Gregorian calendar backward and forward in time for

consult the SPICELIB routines TPARTV and JUL2GR for a discussion
concerning conversions to the Gregorian calendar and ET. The functions
<a href="../cspice/timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a> and <a href="../cspice/str2et_c.html">str2et_c</a>, used together, also support conversions from

<A NAME="Parsing Time Strings"></A>

<H3> Parsing Time Strings
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   A time string is parsed by first scanning the string from left to right
   and identifying recognizable substrings. (integers, punctuation marks,
   names of months, names of weekdays and time systems, time zones, etc.)
   These recognizable substrings are called the tokens of the input string.
   The meaning of some tokens are immediately determined. For example named
   months, weekdays and time systems have clear meanings. However, the
   meanings of numeric components must be deciphered from their magnitudes
   and location in the string relative to the immediately recognized
   components of the input string.
<P>
 
   The following substrings are immediately recognizable.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> All months (January, February, ... ) or any abbreviation of at least 3
letters;
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> All weekdays (Sunday, Monday, ... ) or any abbreviation of at least 3
letters;
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> Standard abbreviations of U.S. time zones: ``EST'', ``EDT'', ``CST'',
``CDT'', ``MST'', ``MDT'', ``PDT'', ``PST'';
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>4.</TT> The abbreviations for eras: ``B.C.'', ``BC'', ``A.D.'', and ``AD'';
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>5.</TT> Time systems: ``TT'', ``TDT'', ``TDB'', ``UTC'' (Note that ``ET'' is not a
recognized time system);
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>6.</TT> Julian Date Label: ``JD'' (Note that ``JED'' is not a recognized Julian
Date Label);
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>7.</TT> The 12-hour clock labels: ``A.M.'', ``AM'', ``P.M.'' and ``PM'';
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>8.</TT> Time Zones expressed as UTC offsets: UTC+HR:MN, UTC-HR:MN where HR is an
unsigned integer between 0 and 12 inclusive; MN is an unsigned integer
between 0 and 59 inclusive.
<BR><BR></UL>
   With the exception of months, all items above may be enclosed in
   parentheses. For example ``TDB'' and ``(TDB)'' are both recognized as
   the same time system.
<P>
 
   The case of the letters in these substrings does not matter. For example
   all of the various ways of writing ``TDB'' ( ``TDB'', ``tDB'', ...
   ``tdb'') are recognized as ``TDB''.
<P>
 
   It is not necessary to leave space between the various substrings. For
   example ``JDTDT'' and ``JDUTC'' are recognized as ``JD'' followed by
   ``TDT'' and ``JD'' followed by ``UTC'' respectively.
<P>
 
   To determine the meaning of the numeric tokens in the input string, a
   set of transformation rules are applied to the full set of tokens in the
   string. These transformations are repeated until the meaning of every
   token has been determined or until further transformations yield no new
   clues into the meaning of the numeric tokens. Here is an overview of the
   rules that are applied to the various tokens in the string.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> Unless the substring ``JD'' or ``jd'' is present, the string is assumed to
be a calendar format (day-month-year or year and day of year). If the
substring JD or jd is present, the string is assumed to represent a Julian
date.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> If the Julian date specifier is not present, any integer greater than 999
is regarded as being a year specification.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> A dash ``-'' can represent a minus sign only if it precedes the first digit
in the string and the string contains the Julian date specifier (JD). (No
negative years, months, days, etc. are allowed).
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>4.</TT> Numeric components of a time string must be separated by a character that
is not a digit or decimal point. Only one decimal component is allowed. For
example 1994219.12819 is sometimes interpreted as the 219th day of 1994 +
0.12819 days. The SPICE time subsystem does not support such strings.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>5.</TT> No exponential components are allowed. For example you can't specify the
Julian date of J2000 as 2.451545E6. You also can't input 1993 Jun 23
23:00:01.202E-4 and have to explicitly list all zeros that follow the
decimal point: i.e. 1993 Jun 23 23:00:00.0001202.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>6.</TT> The single colon (:) when used to separate numeric components of a string
is interpreted as separating Hours, Minutes, and Seconds of time.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>7.</TT> If a double slash (//) or double colon (::) follows a pair of integers,
those integers are assumed to represent the year and day of year.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>8.</TT> A quote followed by an integer less than 100 is regarded as an abbreviated
year. For example: '93 would be regarded as the 93rd year of the reference
century. See the SPICELIB routine TEXPYR for further discussion of
abbreviated years.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>9.</TT> An integer followed by "B.C." or "A.D." is regarded as a year in the era
associated with that abbreviation.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>10.</TT> All dates are regarded as belonging to the extended Gregorian Calendar (the
Gregorian calendar is the calendar currently used by western society). See
the function <a href="../cspice/timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a> to modify this behavior.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>11.</TT> If the ISO date-time separator (T) is present in the string ISO allowed
token patterns are examined for a match with the current token list. If no
match is found the search is abandoned and appropriate diagnostic messages
are generated. Historically the interpretation of ISO formatted time
strings deviates from the ISO standard in allowing two digit years and
expanding years in the 0 to 99 range the same way as is done for non ISO
formatted strings. Due to this interpretation it is impossible to specify
times in years in the 0 A.D. to 99 A.D. range using ISO formatted strings
on the input.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>12.</TT> iIf two delimiters are found in succession in the time string, the time
string is diagnosed as an erroneous string. (Delimiters are comma, white
space, dash, slash, period, or day of year mark. The day of year mark is a
pair of forward slashes or a pair of colons.)
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>&#32;&#32;</TT> Note the delimiters do not have to be the same. The pair of characters ",-"
counts as two successive delimiters.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>13.</TT> White space and commas serve only to delimit tokens in the input string.
They do not affect the meaning of any of the tokens.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>14.</TT> If an integer is greater than 1000 (and the "JD" label is not present, the
integer is regarded as a year.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>15.</TT> When the size of the integer components does not clearly specify a year the
following patterns are assumed
<BR><BR></UL>
<PRE>
            Calendar Format
 
               Year Month Day
               Month Day Year
               Year Day Month
 
               where Month is the name of a month, not its numeric
               value.
 
               When integer components are separated by slashes (/)
               as in 3/4/5. Month, Day, Year is assumed (2005 March 4)
 
            Day of Year Format.
 
               If a day of year marker is present (// or ::) the
               pattern
 
                 I-I// or I-I:: (where I stands for an integer)
 
               is interpreted as Year Day-of-Year. However, I-I/ is
               regarded as ambiguous.
</PRE>
   Once the various tokens have been determined and a meaning attached to
   them, the Time subsystem uses the tokens to construct the double
   precision number giving the number of seconds past J2000 that
   corresponds to input string. However, not all tokens or token
   combinations are allowed by the functions.

<H3> Labels (A.M. and P.M.)
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   If you add more information to the string, the time parser makes a more
   informed interpretation of the time string. For example:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   1988 June 13, 3:29:48 P.M.
</PRE>
   is still regarded as a UTC epoch. However, with the addition of the
   ``P.M.'' label it is now interpreted as the same epoch as the unlabeled
   epoch 1988 June 13, 15:29:48. Similarly
<P>
 
<PRE>
   1988 June 13, 12:29:48 A.M.
</PRE>
   is interpreted as
<P>
 
<PRE>
   1988 June 13, 00:29:48
</PRE>
   on the 24-hour clock.
<P>
 
   12:00 A.M. corresponds to Midnight (00:00 on the 24-hour clock). 12:00
   P.M. corresponds to Noon (12:00 on the 24-hour clock).
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Labels Time Zones"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Labels (Time Zones)
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   You may add still further indicators to the string. For example
<P>
 
<PRE>
   1988 June 13, 3:29:48 P.M. PST
</PRE>
   is interpreted as an epoch in the Pacific Standard Time system. This is
   equivalent to
<P>
 
<PRE>
   1988 June 13, 23:29:48 UTC
</PRE>
   All of the standard abbreviations for U.S. time zones are recognized by
   the time parser.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   EST   --- Eastern Standard Time  ( UTC-5:00 )
   CST   --- Central Standard Time  ( UTC-6:00 )
   MST   --- Mountain Standard Time ( UTC-7:00 )
   PST   --- Pacific Standard Time  ( UTC-8:00 )
 
   EDT   --- Eastern Daylight Time  ( UTC-4:00 )
   CDT   --- Central Daylight Time  ( UTC-5:00 )
   MDT   --- Mountain Daylight Time ( UTC-6:00 )
   PDT   --- Pacific Daylight Time  ( UTC-7:00 )
</PRE>
   In addition, any other time zone may be specified by representing its
   offset from UTC.
<P>
 
   To specify an offset from UTC you need to create an offset label. The
   label starts with the letters `UTC' followed by a `+' for time zones
   east of Greenwich and `-' for time zones west of Greenwich. This is
   followed by the number of hours to add or subtract from UTC. This is
   optionally followed by a colon `:' and the number of minutes to add or
   subtract to get the local time zone. Thus to specify the time zone of
   Calcutta (which is 5 and 1/2 hours ahead of UTC) you would specify the
   time zone to be UTC+5:30. To specify the time zone of Newfoundland
   (which is 3 and 1/2 hours behind UTC) use the offset notation UTC-3:30.

<H3> Labels ( TDB, TT, and UTC )
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   In addition to specifying time zones you may specify that the string be
   interpreted as a formal calendar representation in either the
   Barycentric Dynamical Time system (TDB) or the Terrestrial Time system
   (TT).
<P>
 
   In these systems there are no leapseconds; every day has exactly 86400
   seconds. TDB times are written as

<H3> Default Time Systems, Time Zone, and Calendar
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   When a string is presented without a time system or time zone label the
   parsing logic assumes that the string represents a time in a default
   time zone or time system. If you take no action, the default time system
   is UTC. (There is no time zone offset; UTC is the same as UTC+00:00) You
   can override the default by simply including the time zone or time
   system of interest in the input time string. However, under some
   circumstances you may find that you almost always use the TDB time
   system. In such a case you would normally need to include the TDB label
   in the time string. Hence, the defaults used by the Time Subsystem might
   be a hindrance rather than a convenience. With this possibility in mind,
   the user may alter default behavior with regard to default time system
   or time zone. To change the default time system, time zone, or calendar
   use the appropriate ``SET'' function:

   Keep in mind that if you specify a time zone or time system label in the

   Three time systems are supported: UTC, TDB, TDT, and TT. To change the
   default system to one of these three systems, use the appropriate
   function call, i.e.:

   The default time zone is simply Greenwich Mean Time (UTC+00:00). To
   change the default behavior of the Time Subsystem so that unlabeled
   strings are assumed to be referenced to a particular time zone (for
   example Pacific Standard Time) use the appropriate function:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a> ( "SET", "ZONE", lenout, "PST" );

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Calendars"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Calendars
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The default calendar used by the Time Subsystem is the Gregorian
   calendar. However, the Gregorian calendar did not exist until October
   15, 1582 (the prior day having date October 5, 1582). To complicate
   matters, many countries did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until
   centuries later. Prior to adoption of the Gregorian calendar most
   western societies used the Julian calendar. The generation of successive
   days is identical on the Julian and Gregorian calendars except for the
   determination of leap days in years exactly divisible by 100. On the
   Julian calendar, a leap day is inserted as the last day of February
   every 4 years. The Gregorian calendar adds a leap day as the last day of
   February every 4 years with the exception of years exactly divisible by
   100. Such years are leap years only if the year is evenly divisible by
   400. Thus the year 2000 is a leap year on the Gregorian calendar but
   1900 is not.
<P>
 
   Both the Gregorian and Julian calendars can be extended forward and
   backward in time indefinitely. The default behavior uses the Gregorian
   calendar for all epochs. However, using the <a href="../cspice/timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a> function `SET'
   capability, you can set the default calendar to one of three: GREGORIAN,
   JULIAN, or MIXED:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../cspice/timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a> ( "SET", "CALENDAR", lenout, "GREGORIAN" );
   <a href="../cspice/timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a> ( "SET", "CALENDAR", lenout, "JULIAN"    );
   <a href="../cspice/timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a> ( "SET", "CALENDAR", lenout, "MIXED"     );
</PRE>
   The ``MIXED'' calendar assumes that calendar strings for epochs prior to
   October 5, 1582 belong to the Julian Calendar; strings for later epochs
   are assumed to belong to the Gregorian Calendar. The specification of a
   calendar does not affect a previous setting of a time system or time
   zone.

   Starting with the N0057 release of the Fortran SPICE Toolkit, SPICELIB,
   (March, 2004) the data loading mechanism detects and prohibits loading
   text kernel files containing lines terminated with EOF character(s)
   non-native to the platform on which the Toolkit was compiled. If a
   non-native EOL terminator is detected in the first 132 characters of a
   text kernel, the execution is stopped and an error message is displayed.
   This feature does not work with files that are smaller that 132 bytes or
   have the first line longer that 132 characters.

<H1> Appendix C. Parsing Time Strings
</H1><HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE><P><BR><BR><BR>
   This appendix gives a detailed account of how the SPICELIB routine
   TPARTV analyzes and assigns meaning to the components of a time string.
   TPARTV is the ``foundation'' routine relied upon by all other routines
   that have time strings as input arguments.
<P>
 
   This appendix is not for everyone. Unless you need to understand in
   great detail how parsing of strings is performed, you can safely skip
   this appendix. The discussion below is quite technical and mirrors very
   closely the code in TPARTV that handles the parsing of time strings.

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> An Outline of the Parser
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The first step in processing a time string is to scan it from left to
   right identifying various substrings. If a substring is encountered that
   cannot be identified, attempts to further process the string are
   abandoned.
<P>
 
   Having identified the components in the string as integers, months,
   weekdays, time systems, etc. an internal representation of the string is
   constructed. This representation is simply a list of the identified
   substrings in the order they are encountered. Each item in the list is
   called a token.
<P>
 
   Working with the list of tokens, various rules are applied to remove
   some tokens and combine others into new tokens. The process of
   combination and removal of tokens continues until all tokens belong to a
   special set of ``meaningful'' tokens or until no further combinations
   and removals can be performed. If processing stops before all tokens are
   meaningful, a diagnostic message is created and the string is regarded
   as un-parsable. If all of the tokens are meaningful, a compatibility
   check is performed on the tokens to make sure that they unambiguously
   specify an epoch.
<P>
 
   Once it is clear that an unambiguous epoch has been specified, the
   substrings corresponding to the meaningful tokens are converted into
   numeric representations or are noted so that the time conversion
   software can properly interpret the numeric components.
<P>
 
   Almost all of the work of manipulating tokens is carried out by SPICE
   private routines. These routines are not considered part of the SPICE
   public interface. Feel free to read and copy these routines. However, we
   strongly recommend that you not call these routines in your own code
   since we do not guarantee backward compatibility of these routines in
   future releases of the Toolkit.

   The first step in parsing a time string is to decompose it into
   recognizable substring components. This decomposition is done as
   follows:
<P>
 
   Starting with the next unexamined character (on the first pass this is
   the first character in the string), scan from left to right looking for
   one of the following classes of substrings:

   Once the next substring has been identified, its boundaries and
   classification are stored in the next available location in the buffer
   reserved for the tokenized representation of the time string.
<P>
 
   The steps above are then repeated until the entire substring has been
   tokenized or a failure to recognize some substring occurs. If a failure
   occurs the location in the string is noted and a diagnostic message is
   created indicating the failure in the attempt to parse the string.
<P>
 
   When the tokenization is finished, there will be a list of tokens from
   which a string can be constructed that lists the class of each token.
   Each class of token is represented by a single character. By placing
   these characters in a string a simple list of token classes is
   maintained. The characters used for the remainder of this discussion are
   listed below.

   Once an internal tokenized representation of the time string has been

   There are 3 basic operations that can be performed on the tokenized

<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> A sequence of tokens can be combined into a single new token with a
potentially new classification. For example you might have a subsequence of

strings such as ``January.''
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> The right most sequence of tokens of the form ``i.i'',
(integer-period-integer) or ``i.'' (integer-period) is combined to form a

<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> Any token sequence of the form `[s]' ( left parenthesis - time system -

specification in the tokenization.

the next step is to remove all tokens classified as `*' from the token
list. In the remainder of the discussion, we will not add the sentence
describing the removal of all asterisks. It will be implicit that the
asterisk is always removed after it is placed in the token list.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> If the token sequence `[j]' (left parenthesis - Julian date specifier -
right parenthesis) is present, it is replaced by `*j*'
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> If no number token, `n', (see above) is present in the tokenization, the
left most integer (`i') is reclassified as a number ( `n' ).
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>4.</TT> If the token sequence `-n' ( dash - number ) appears in the token list, it
is combined and classified as a number (`n'). This allows for the input of
negative Julian dates.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>5.</TT> The Julian date specifier `j' is noted and removed from the token list.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>6.</TT> Any system token (`s') present in the token list is noted and removed.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>7.</TT> The numeric components of the string are converted to double precision

that should be in the token list at this point is a single numeric token.)
<BR><BR></UL>

<H3> Calendar Dates
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   If the Julian date specifier was not present in the token list, we
   assume that the string and token list represents a calendar date format.
   One consequence of this assumption is that the dash `-' is now assumed
   to be just a punctuation mark and not part of a number. ISO formats are
   given first priority in the scheme of token resolution. Note that ISO
   formats do not allow the inclusion of time systems, time zones, eras, or
   12-hour clocks.
<P>
 
   Any integer class tokens (`i') whose corresponding substrings represent
   integers greater than or equal to 1000 are reclassified as years (`Y').

   in the left column it is transformed to the corresponding item in the

   transformations. The ISO time string may also end with the "Z" suffix.
   There is no difference in the interpretation with or without the suffix.

   Having processed the token list to this point, we check to see if what
   remains is one of those in a large set of immediately recognized token
   lists. The complete list is shown below. As in the case of ISO formats,
   the left item is the token list, the right item is the transformation
   after removing delimiters. Note that the letter `d' stands for a
   day-of-year delimiter ( `//' or `::' ).

</H3><P><BR><BR>
   As can be surmised from the preceding discussion, it is very difficult
   to give a complete list of all token patterns that might yield a parsed
   time string. Nevertheless, we feel that the approach taken and the
   transformations applied will yield correct and consistent
   interpretations of the many ways people choose to represent time.

   The CSPICE library is an implementation of the FORTRAN SPICELIB library
   in C. CSPICE is composed of C routines translated to C from FORTRAN by
   f2c, and a set of wrapper functions which allow a more C native
   interface to the f2c'd routines.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>&#32;&#32;</TT> A routine name which ends in an underscore, ``_'', is an f2c translated
routine (pckopn_).
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>&#32;&#32;</TT> A routine name ending in and underscore c, ``_c'', is a wrapper routine
(<a href="../cspice/mxm_c.html">mxm_c</a>). It is strongly suggested that the user calls a wrapper routine
whenever available as opposed to the f2c translated counterpart.

<TT>&#32;&#32;</TT> A routine name in all capital letters (SPKEZR) is a SPICELIB FORTRAN
routine.

<TT>&#32;&#32;</TT> Arguments in routine calls with the suffix ``_len'' or prefix ``len'' are
the lengths of the strings in the argument list.

   This edition of TIME Required Reading documents the routine <a href="../cspice/et2lst_c.html">et2lst_c</a>.
   This routine allows user's to easily convert Ephemeris Time (Barycentric
   Dynamical Time) to the local solar time at a user specified longitude on
   the surface of an object.
<P>
 
   In addition to the new routine <a href="../cspice/et2lst_c.html">et2lst_c</a>, we document a slight extension
   of the set of time strings that are recognized by the SPICE time
   software. This extension is documented in Appendix B.

   This edition of TIME Required Reading is a substantial revision to the
   previous edition; this reflects a major enhancement of the SPICE time
   software. This version describes the new time related software that was
   included in version N0046 of SPICE . We also draw distinctions between
   the various levels of time conversion software that are available to
   Toolkit users.
<P>
 
   The following routines are new as of version N0046.

   This version differs substantially from the previous version of 13 April
   1992. Much of the description of the time software has been redone and
   sections added to describe how to modify time string parsing behavior
   and the conversion between uniform time systems.

   This version differs from the previous version of 10 April 1991 in that
   it discusses the new routine, UNITIM, for converting between additive
   numeric time systems.
