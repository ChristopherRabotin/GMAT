   method      is a short string providing parameters defining
               the computation method to be used. Parameters
               include, but are not limited to, the shape model
               used to represent the surface of the target body.

               The only choice currently supported is

                  &quot;Ellipsoid&quot;        The intercept computation uses
                                     a triaxial ellipsoid to model
                                     the surface of the target body.
                                     The ellipsoid's radii must be
                                     available in the kernel pool.

               Neither case nor white space are significant in
               `method'. For example, the string &quot; eLLipsoid &quot; is
               valid.

               In a later Toolkit release, this argument will be
               used to invoke a wider range of surface
               representations. For example, it will be possible to
               represent the target body's surface using a digital
               model.

   target      is the name of the target body.  `target' is
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
               `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may supply
               a string containing the integer ID code for the object.
               For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings
               that indicate the moon is the target body.

               When the target body's surface is represented by a
               tri-axial ellipsoid, this routine assumes that a kernel
               variable representing the ellipsoid's radii is present
               in the kernel pool. Normally the kernel variable would
               be defined by loading a PCK file.

   et          is the epoch of participation of the observer, expressed
               as ephemeris seconds past J2000 TDB: `et' is the epoch
               at which the observer's state is computed.

               When aberration corrections are not used, `et' is also
               the epoch at which the state and orientation of the
               target body are computed.

               When aberration corrections are used, `et' is the epoch
               at which the observer's state relative to the solar
               system barycenter is computed; in this case the position
               and orientation of the target body are computed at et-lt
               or et+lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time between
               the intercept point and the observer, and the sign
               applied to lt depends on the selected correction. See
               the description of `abcorr' below for details.

   abcorr      indicates the aberration correction to be applied
               when computing the observer-target state and the
               orientation of the target body.  `abcorr' may be any of
               the following.

                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction. Return the
                             geometric surface intercept point on the
                             target body.

               Let `lt' represent the one-way light time between the
               observer and the surface intercept point (note: NOT
               between the observer and the target body's center).
               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               intercept point's location at the light-time
               corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's
               location at `et':

                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the location of the surface
                             intercept point at the moment it
                             emitted photons arriving at the
                             observer at `et'.

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation. The solution invoked by the
                             &quot;LT&quot; option uses one iteration.

                             Both the target state as seen by the
                             observer, and rotation of the target
                             body, are corrected for light time.

                  &quot;LT+S&quot;     Correct for one-way light time and
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This option modifies the
                             state obtained with the &quot;LT&quot; option to
                             account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The result is the apparent
                             surface intercept point as seen by the
                             observer.

                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates
                             until the solution converges. Both the
                             state and rotation of the target body
                             are corrected for light time.

                  &quot;CN+S&quot;     Converged Newtonian light time
                             and stellar aberration corrections.

               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the
               intercept point at the light-time corrected epoch
               et+lt:

                  &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This correction yields the
                             intercept location at the moment it
                             receives photons emitted from the
                             observer's location at `et'.

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation. The solution invoked by the
                             &quot;LT&quot; option uses one iteration.

                             Both the target state as seen by the
                             observer, and rotation of the target
                             body, are corrected for light time.

                  &quot;XLT+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation  This option modifies the
                             intercept obtained with the &quot;XLT&quot;
                             option to account for the observer's
                             velocity relative to the solar system
                             barycenter.

                  &quot;XCN&quot;      Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. This is the same as &quot;XLT&quot;
                             correction but with further iterations
                             to a converged Newtonian light time
                             solution.

                  &quot;XCN+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

   obsrvr      is the name of the observing body. This is typically
               a spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the
               earth.  `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and
               trailing blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant.
               Optionally, you may supply a string containing the
               integer ID code for the object. For example both
               &quot;EARTH&quot; and &quot;399&quot; are legitimate strings that indicate
               the earth is the observer.

   dref        is the name of the reference frame relative to which the
               input direction vector is expressed. This may be any
               frame supported by the SPICE system, including built-in
               frames (documented in the Frames Required Reading) and
               frames defined by a loaded frame kernel (FK).

               When `dref' designates a non-inertial frame, the
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at an epoch
               dependent on the frame's center and, if the center is
               not the observer, on the selected aberration
               correction. See the description of the direction
               vector `dvec' for details.

   dvec        is a pointing vector emanating from the observer. The
               intercept with the target body's surface of the ray
               defined by the observer and `dvec' is sought.

               `dvec' is specified relative to the reference frame
               designated by `dref'.

               Non-inertial reference frames are treated as follows:
               if the center of the frame is at the observer's
               location, the frame is evaluated at `et'. If the
               frame's center is located elsewhere, then letting
               `ltcent' be the one-way light time between the observer
               and the central body associated with the frame, the
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at et-ltcent,
               et+ltcent, or `et' depending on whether the requested
               aberration correction is, respectively, for received
               radiation, transmitted radiation, or is omitted.
               `ltcent' is computed using the method indicated by
               `abcorr'.

<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
   spoint      is the surface intercept point on the target body of
               the ray defined by the observer and the direction
               vector. If the ray intersects the target body in
               multiple points, the selected intersection point is
               the one closest to the observer. The output
               argument `found' (see below) indicates whether an
               intercept was found.

               `spoint' is expressed in Cartesian coordinates,
               relative to the body-fixed frame associated with the
               target body. The body-fixed target frame is
               evaluated at the intercept epoch `trgepc' (see
               description below).

               When light time correction is used, the duration of
               light travel between `spoint' to the observer is
               considered to be the one way light time. When both
               light time and stellar aberration corrections are
               used, `spoint' is selected such that, when `spoint' is
               corrected for light time and the vector from the
               observer to the light-time corrected location of
               `spoint' is corrected for stellar aberration, the
               resulting vector is parallel to the ray defined by
               the observer's location and `dvec'.

               The components of `spoint' are given in units of km.

   dist        is the distance between the observer and the surface
               intercept on the target body.  `dist' is given in units
               of km.

   trgepc      is the &quot;intercept epoch.&quot; This is the epoch at which
               the ray defined by `obsrvr' and `dvec' intercepts the
               target surface at `spoint'.  `trgepc' is defined as
               follows: letting `lt' be the one-way light time between
               the observer and the intercept point, `trgepc' is the
               epoch et-lt, et+lt, or `et' depending on whether the
               requested aberration correction is, respectively, for
               received radiation, transmitted radiation, or
               omitted. `lt' is computed using the method indicated by
               `abcorr'.

               `trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

   obspos      is the vector from the center of the target body at
               epoch `trgepc' to the observer at epoch `et'.  `obspos' is
               expressed in the target body-fixed reference frame
               evaluated at `trgepc'. (This is the frame relative to
               which `spoint' is given.)

               `obspos' is returned to simplify various related
               computations that would otherwise be cumbersome. For
               example, the vector `xvec' from the observer to `spoint'
               can be calculated via the call

                  <a href="vsub_c.html">vsub_c</a> ( spoint, obspos, xvec );

               The components of `obspos' are given in units of km.

   found       is a logical flag indicating whether or not the ray
               intersects the target. If an intersection exists
               `found' will be returned as SPICETRUE. If the ray misses
               the target, `found' will be returned as SPICEFALSE.

   Appropriate SPK, PCK, and frame kernels must be loaded by the
   calling program before this routine is called.  CK, SCLK, and
   IK kernels may be required as well.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: ephemeris data for target and observer must be
      loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of
      target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
      must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.
      Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one
      or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   -  PCK data: if the computation method is specified as
      &quot;Ellipsoid,&quot; triaxial radii for the target body must be
      loaded into the kernel pool. Typically this is done by
      loading a text PCK file via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   -  Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must
      be loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK
      file.

   -  Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert
      the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of
      the target, that definition must be available in the kernel
      pool. Similarly, the frame definition required to map
      between the frame designated by `dref' and the target
      body-fixed frame must be available. Typically the
      definitions of frames not already built-in to SPICE are
      supplied by loading a frame kernel.

   The following data may be required:

   -  CK data: if the frame to which `dref' refers is fixed to
      a spacecraft instrument or structure, at least one CK file will
      be needed to permit transformation of vectors between that
      frame and both J2000 and the target body-fixed frame.

   -  SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK kernel
      is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
      (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
      (TDB).

   -  IK data: one or more I-kernels may be required to
      enable transformation of vectors from an instrument-fixed
      frame to a spacecraft-fixed frame whose attitude is given
      by a C-kernel.


   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

   Given a ray defined by a direction vector and the location of an
   observer, <b>srfxpt_c</b> computes the surface intercept point of the ray
   on a specified target body. <b>srfxpt_c</b> also determines the distance
   between the observer and the surface intercept point.

   When aberration corrections are used, this routine finds the
   value of `spoint' such that, if `spoint' is regarded as an ephemeris
   object, after the selected aberration corrections are applied to
   the vector from the observer to `spoint', the resulting vector is
   parallel to the direction vector `dvec'.

   This routine computes light time corrections using light time
   between the observer and the surface intercept point, as opposed
   to the center of the target. Similarly, stellar aberration
   corrections done by this routine are based on the direction of
   the vector from the observer to the light-time corrected
   intercept point, not to the target center. This technique avoids
   errors due to the differential between aberration corrections
   across the target body. Therefore it's valid to use aberration
   corrections with this routine even when the observer is very
   close to the intercept point, in particular when the
   observer-intercept point distance is much less than the
   observer-target center distance. It's also valid to use stellar
   aberration corrections even when the intercept point is near or
   on the limb (as may occur in occultation computations using a
   point target).

   When comparing surface intercept point computations with results
   from sources other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the
   same geometric definitions are used.

   The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
   specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) The following program computes surface intercept points on
      Mars for the boresight and FOV boundary vectors of the MGS MOC
      narrow angle camera. The intercepts are computed for a single
      observation epoch. Light time and stellar aberration
      corrections are used. For simplicity, camera distortion is
      ignored.

   2) <b>srfxpt_c</b> will signal an error if required kernel data are
      unavailable: for example, in the program of Example 1, if the
      C-kernel containing data for the MGS bus had a gap at epoch `et',
      <b>srfxpt_c</b> would be unable to transform the direction vector `dvec'
      from the reference frame fixed to the camera to the reference
      frame fixed to the target body.

      We could modify the code of Example 1 as shown below to test for
      the availability of C-kernel data. We would add the declarations
      shown, and we'd call the C-kernel reader <a href="ckgp_c.html">ckgp_c</a> to find whether the
      desired pointing was available. Depending on the value of the
      `found' flag returned by <a href="ckgp_c.html">ckgp_c</a>, we'd go on to compute the surface
      intercept point or respond to the error condition.

   1)  A cautionary note: if aberration corrections are used, and if
       `dref' is the target body-fixed frame, the epoch at which that
       frame is evaluated is offset from `et' by the light time between
       the observer and the *center* of the target body. This light
       time normally will differ from the light time between the
       observer and intercept point. Consequently the orientation of
       the target body-fixed frame at `trgepc' will not match that of
       the target body-fixed frame at the epoch associated with `dref'.
       As a result, various derived quantities may not be as
       expected: for example, `obspos' would not be the inverse of the
       aberration-corrected position of the target as seen by the
       observer.

       In many applications the errors arising from this frame
       discrepancy may be insignificant; however a safe approach is
       to always use as `dref' a frame other than the target body-fixed
       frame.
