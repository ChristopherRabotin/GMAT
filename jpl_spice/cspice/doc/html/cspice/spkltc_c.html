   targ        is the NAIF ID code for a target body. The target
               and observer define a state vector whose position
               component points from the observer to the target.

   et          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past
               J2000 TDB, at which the state of the target body
               relative to the observer is to be computed. `et'
               refers to time at the observer's location.

   ref         is the inertial reference frame with respect to which
               the input state `stobs' and the output state `starg' are
               expressed. `ref' must be recognized by the CSPICE
               Toolkit. The acceptable frames are listed in the Frames
               Required Reading, as well as in the CSPICE routine
               chgirf_.

               Case and blanks are not significant in the string
               `ref'.


   abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
               the state of the target body to account for one-way
               light time. See the discussion in the -Particulars
               section for recommendations on how to choose
               aberration corrections.

               If `abcorr' includes the stellar aberration correction
               symbol &quot;+S&quot;, this flag is simply ignored. Aside from
               the possible presence of this symbol, `abcorr' may be
               any of the following:

                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction. Return the
                             geometric state of the target body
                             relative to the observer.

               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at `et':

                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the state of the target at the
                             moment it emitted photons arriving at
                             the observer at `et'.

                             The light time correction involves
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation (see -Particulars for details).
                             The solution invoked by the &quot;LT&quot; option
                             uses one iteration.

                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates
                             until the solution converges (three
                             iterations on all supported platforms).
                             Whether the &quot;CN+S&quot; solution is
                             substantially more accurate than the
                             &quot;LT&quot; solution depends on the geometry
                             of the participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed. See the -Particulars section of
                             <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> for a discussion of precision of
                             light time corrections.

               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et+lt:

                  &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This correction yields the
                             state of the target at the moment it
                             receives photons emitted from the
                             observer's location at `et'.

                  &quot;XCN&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.


               Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
               accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
               by this routine.

               Case and blanks are not significant in the string
               `abcorr'.


   stobs       is the geometric (uncorrected) state of the observer
               relative to the solar system barycenter at epoch `et'.
               `stobs' is a 6-vector: the first three components of
               `stobs' represent a Cartesian position vector; the last
               three components represent the corresponding velocity
               vector. `stobs' is expressed relative to the inertial
               reference frame designated by `ref'.

               Units are always km and km/sec.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>

   starg       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position
               and velocity of the target body relative to the
               specified observer. `starg' is corrected for the
               specified aberration, and is expressed with respect
               to the specified inertial reference frame. The first
               three components of `starg' represent the x-, y- and
               z-components of the target's position; last three
               components form the corresponding velocity vector.

               The position component of `starg' points from the
               observer's location at `et' to the aberration-corrected
               location of the target. Note that the sense of the
               position vector is independent of the direction of
               radiation travel implied by the aberration
               correction.

               Units are always km and km/sec.

   lt          is the one-way light time between the observer and
               target in seconds. If the target state is corrected
               for light time, then `lt' is the one-way light time
               between the observer and the light time-corrected
               target location.

   dlt         is the derivative with respect to barycentric
               dynamical time of the one way light time between
               target and observer:

                  dlt = d(lt)/d(et)

               `dlt' can also be described as the rate of change of
               one way light time. `dlt' is unitless, since `lt' and
               `et' both have units of TDB seconds.

               If the observer and target are at the same position,
               then `dlt' is set to zero.

   1)  For the convenience of the caller, the input aberration
       correction flag can call for stellar aberration correction via
       inclusion of the &quot;+S&quot; suffix. This portion of the aberration
       correction flag is ignored if present.

   2)  If the value of `abcorr' is not recognized, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   3)  If the reference frame requested is not a recognized
       inertial reference frame, the error SPICE(BADFRAME)
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   4)  If the state of the target relative to the solar system
       barycenter cannot be computed, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   5)  If the observer and target are at the same position,
       then `dlt' is set to zero. This situation could arise,
       for example, when the observer is Mars and the target
       is the Mars barycenter.

   6)  If a division by zero error would occur in the computation of
       `dlt', the error SPICE(DIVIDEBYZERO) is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   7)  If any of the `ref' or `abcorr' input string pointers is null,
       the error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled.

   8)  If any of the `ref' or `abcorr' input strings has zero length,
       the error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled.

<h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4>
<PRE>
   This routine computes states using SPK files that have been
   loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading
   interface routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. Application programs typically load
   kernels once before this routine is called, for example during
   program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly.
   See the routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading
   for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels.

   If any of the ephemeris data used to compute `starg' are expressed
   relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those
   data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference
   frame transformations required to compute the state. Normally
   these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels. Any
   such kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is
   called.

<h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4>

   This routine supports higher-level SPK API routines that can
   perform both light time and stellar aberration corrections.
   User applications normally will not need to call this routine
   directly.

   See the header of the routine <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> for a detailed discussion
   of aberration corrections.

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
   specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) Look up a sequence of states of the Moon as seen from the
      Earth. Use light time corrections. Compute the first state for
      the epoch 2000 JAN 1 12:00:00 TDB; compute subsequent states at
      intervals of 1 hour. For each epoch, display the states, the
      one way light time between target and observer, and the rate of
      change of the one way light time.

<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>
<PRE>
   1)  The routine <a href="spkgeo_c.html">spkgeo_c</a> should be used instead of this routine
       to compute geometric states. <a href="spkgeo_c.html">spkgeo_c</a> introduces less
       round-off error when the observer and target have common
       center that is closer to both objects than is the solar
       system barycenter.

   2)  The kernel files to be used by <b>spkltc_c</b> must be loaded
       (normally by the CSPICE kernel loader <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>) before
       this routine is called.

   3)  Unlike most other SPK state computation routines, this
       routine requires that the output state be relative to an
       inertial reference frame.
