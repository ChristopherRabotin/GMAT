   target      is the name of the target body.  `target' is
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
               `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may
               supply a string containing the integer ID code for
               the object. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are
               legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
               target body.

   et          is the epoch, specified in ephemeris seconds past
               J2000, at which the apparent illumination angles at
               the specified surface point on the target body, as
               seen from the observing body, are to be computed.

   abcorr      is the aberration correction to be used in
               computing the location and orientation of the
               target body and the location of the Sun. Possible
               values are:

                  &quot;NONE&quot;        No aberration correction.

                  &quot;LT&quot;          Correct the position and
                                orientation of target body for
                                light time, and correct the
                                position of the Sun for light
                                time.

                  &quot;LT+S&quot;        Correct the observer-target vector
                                for light time and stellar
                                aberration, correct the
                                orientation of the target body
                                for light time, and correct the
                                target-Sun vector for light time
                                and stellar aberration.

                                correction. In solving the light
                                time equation, the &quot;CN&quot; correction
                                iterates until the solution
                                converges (three iterations on all
                                supported platforms). Whether the
                                &quot;CN+S&quot; solution is substantially
                                more accurate than the &quot;LT&quot; solution
                                depends on the geometry of the
                                participating objects and on the
                                accuracy of the input data. In all
                                cases this routine will execute more
                                slowly when a converged solution is
                                computed. See the -Particulars

                                time.

   obsrvr      is the name of the observing body. This is typically
               a spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the
               earth.  `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and
               trailing blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant.
               Optionally, you may supply a string containing the
               integer ID code for the object. For example both
               &quot;EARTH&quot; and &quot;399&quot; are legitimate strings that
               indicate the earth is the observer.

               `obsrvr' may be not be identical to `target'.

   spoint      is a surface point on the target body, expressed
               in rectangular body-fixed (body equator and prime
               meridian) coordinates.  `spoint' need not be visible
               from the observer's location at time `et'.

   phase       is the phase angle at `spoint', as seen from `obsrvr'
               at time `et'. This is the angle between the
               spoint-obsrvr vector and the spoint-sun vector.
               Units are radians. The range of `phase' is [0, pi].

   solar       is the solar incidence angle at `spoint', as seen
               from `obsrvr' at time `et'. This is the angle
               between the surface normal vector at `spoint' and the

   1)  If `target' and `obsrvr' are not distinct, the error
       SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   2)  If no SPK (ephemeris) data are available for the observer,
       target, and Sun at the time specified by `et', an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If
       light time corrections are used, SPK data for the target body
       must be available at the time et - lt, where `lt' is the one-way
       light time from the target to the observer at `et'.
       Additionally, SPK data must be available for the Sun at the
       time et - lt - lt2, where `lt2' is the light time from the Sun
       to the target body at time et - lt.

   3)  If PCK data defining the orientation or shape of the target
       body are unavailable, an error is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   4)  If no body-fixed frame is associated with the target body, the
       error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   5)  If name of target or observer cannot be translated to its NAIF
       ID code, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   6)  If radii for `target' are not found in the kernel pool, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   7)  If the size of the `target' body radii kernel variable is not
       three, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   8)  If any of the three `target' body radii is less-than or equal to
       zero, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   9)  If any of the `target', `abcorr' or `obsrvr' input string
       pointers is null, the error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled.

   10) If any of the `target', `abcorr' or `obsrvr' input strings has
       zero length, the error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled.

   The term &quot;illumination angles&quot; refers to following set of
   angles:


      solar incidence angle    Angle between the surface normal at the
                               specified surface point and the vector
                               from the surface point to the Sun.

      emission angle           Angle between the surface normal at the
                               specified surface point and the vector
                               from the surface point to the observer.

      phase angle              Angle between the vectors from the
                               surface point to the observing body and
                               from the surface point to the Sun.


   The diagram below illustrates the geometric relationships defining
   these angles. The labels for the solar incidence, emission, and
   phase angles are &quot;s.i.&quot;, &quot;e.&quot;, and &quot;phase&quot;.

    location           to viewing
    (observer)         location


   Note that if the target-observer vector, the target normal vector
   at the surface point, and the target-sun vector are coplanar, then
   phase is the sum of incidence and emission. This is rarely true;
   usually

      phase angle  &lt;  solar incidence angle + emission angle


   All of the above angles can be computed using light time
   corrections, light time and stellar aberration corrections, or
   no aberration corrections. The way aberration corrections
   are used is described below.

   Care must be used in computing light time corrections. The
   guiding principle used here is &quot;describe what appears in
   an image.&quot; We ignore differential light time; the light times
   from all points on the target to the observer are presumed to be
   equal.


      Observer-target body vector
      ---------------------------

      Let `et' be the epoch at which an observation or remote
      sensing measurement is made, and let et - lt (&quot;lt&quot; stands
      for &quot;light time&quot;) be the epoch at which the photons received
      at `et' were emitted from the body (we use the term &quot;emitted&quot;
      loosely here).

      The correct observer-target vector points from the observer's
      location at `et' to the target body's location at et - lt.
      The target-observer vector points in the opposite direction.

      Since light time corrections are not symmetric, the correct
      target-observer vector CANNOT be found by computing the light
      time corrected position of the observer as seen from the
      target body.


      Target body's orientation
      -------------------------

      Using the definitions of `et' and `lt' above, the target
      body's orientation at et - lt is used. The surface
      normal is dependent on the target body's orientation, so
      the body's orientation model must be evaluated for the correct
      epoch.


      Target body -- Sun vector
      -------------------------

      All surface features on the target body will appear in
      a measurement made at `et' as they were at et-lt. In
      particular, lighting on the target body is dependent on
      the apparent location of the Sun as seen from the target
      body at et-lt. So, a second light time correction is used
      in finding the apparent location of the Sun.


   Stellar aberration corrections, when used, are applied as follows:


      Observer-target body vector
      ---------------------------

      In addition to light time correction, stellar aberration is
      used in computing the apparent target body position as seen
      from the observer's location at time `et'. This apparent
      position defines the observer-target body vector.


      Target body-Sun vector
      ----------------------

      The target body-Sun vector is the apparent position of the Sun,
      corrected for light time and stellar aberration, as seen from
      the target body at time et-lt. Note that the target body's
      position is not affected by the stellar aberration correction
      applied in finding its apparent position as seen by the
      observer.


   Once all of the vectors, as well as the target body's
   orientation, have been computed with the proper aberration
   corrections, the element of time is eliminated from the
   computation. The problem becomes a purely geometric one,
   and is described by the diagram above.

         This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
         example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
         assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
         required by SPICE-based user applications.

         In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
         kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
         current working directory.

         The names and contents of the kernels referenced
         by this meta-kernel are as follows:
