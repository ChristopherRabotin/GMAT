   method      is a short string providing parameters defining
               the computation method to be used. In the syntax
               descriptions below, items delimited by brackets
               are optional.

               `method' may be assigned the following values:

                  &quot;ELLIPSOID&quot;

                     The illumination angle computation uses a
                     triaxial ellipsoid to model the surface of the
                     target body. The ellipsoid's radii must be
                     available in the kernel pool.


                  &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]&quot;

                     The illumination angle computation uses
                     topographic data to model the surface of the
                     target body. These data must be provided by
                     loaded DSK files.

                     The surface list specification is optional. The
                     syntax of the list is

                        &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...]

                     If present, it indicates that data only for the
                     listed surfaces are to be used; however, data
                     need not be available for all surfaces in the
                     list. If absent, loaded DSK data for any surface
                     associated with the target body are used.

                     The surface list may contain surface names or
                     surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must
                     be delimited by escaped double quotes, for example

                        &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;&quot;

                     If multiple surfaces are specified, their names
                     or IDs must be separated by commas.

                     See the -Particulars section below for details
                     concerning use of DSK data.


               Neither case nor white space are significant in `method',
               except within double-quoted strings representing
               surfaces. For example, the string &quot; eLLipsoid &quot; is valid.

               Within double-quoted strings representing surfaces, blank
               characters are significant, but multiple consecutive
               blanks are considered equivalent to a single blank. Case
               is not significant. So

                  \&quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;

               is equivalent to

                  \&quot; mars megdr  128  pixel/deg \&quot;

               but not to

                  \&quot;MARS MEGDR128PIXEL/DEG\&quot;

   target      is the name of the target body. `target' is
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
               `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may
               supply a string containing the integer ID code for
               the object. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are
               legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the
               target body.

   ilusrc      is the name of the illumination source. This source
               may be any ephemeris object. Case, blanks, and
               numeric values are treated in the same way as for the
               input `target'.

   et          is the epoch, expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB,
               for which the apparent illumination angles at the
               specified surface point on the target body, as seen
               from the observing body, are to be computed.

   fixref      is the name of a body-fixed reference frame centered
               on the target body. `fixref' may be any such frame
               supported by the SPICE system, including built-in
               frames (documented in the Frames Required Reading)
               and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel (FK). The
               string `fixref' is case-insensitive, and leading and
               trailing blanks in `fixref' are not significant.

               The input surface point `spoint' and the output vector
               `srfvec' are expressed relative to this reference
               frame.

   abcorr      is the aberration correction to be used in computing
               the position and orientation of the target body and
               the location of the illumination source.

               For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
               illumination angles seen by the observer are desired,
               normally either of the corrections

                  &quot;LT+S&quot;
                  &quot;CN+S&quot;

               should be used. These and the other supported options
               are described below. `abcorr' may be any of the
               following:

                  &quot;NONE&quot;     No aberration correction.

               Let `lt' represent the one-way light time between the
               observer and the input surface point `spoint' (note: NOT
               between the observer and the target body's center). The
               following values of `abcorr' apply to the &quot;reception&quot; case
               in which photons depart from `spoint' at the light-time
               corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's
               location at `et':

                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct both the position of `spoint' as
                             seen by the observer, and the position
                             of the illumination source as seen by
                             the target, for light time. Correct the
                             orientation of the target for light
                             time.

                  &quot;LT+S&quot;     Correct both the position of `spoint' as
                             seen by the observer, and the position
                             of the illumination source as seen by
                             the target, for light time and stellar
                             aberration. Correct the orientation of
                             the target for light time.

                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equations for `spoint' and the
                             illumination source, the &quot;CN&quot;
                             correction iterates until the solution
                             converges.

                  &quot;CN+S&quot;     Converged Newtonian light time and
                             stellar aberration corrections. This
                             option produces a solution that is at
                             least as accurate at that obtainable
                             with the &quot;LT+S&quot; option. Whether the
                             &quot;CN+S&quot; solution is substantially more
                             accurate depends on the geometry of the
                             participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed.


               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *arrive* at
               `spoint' at the light-time corrected epoch et+lt and
               *depart* from the observer's location at `et':

                  &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This correction yields the
                             illumination angles at the moment that
                             `spoint' receives photons emitted from the
                             observer's location at `et'.

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation. The solution invoked by the
                             &quot;XLT&quot; option uses one iteration.

                             Both the target position as seen by the
                             observer, and rotation of the target
                             body, are corrected for light time.

                  &quot;XLT+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation  This option modifies the
                             angles obtained with the &quot;XLT&quot; option
                             to account for the observer's and
                             target's velocities relative to the
                             solar system barycenter (the latter
                             velocity is used in computing the
                             direction to the apparent illumination
                             source).

                  &quot;XCN&quot;      Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. This is the same as XLT
                             correction but with further iterations
                             to a converged Newtonian light time
                             solution.

                  &quot;XCN+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections. This option
                             produces a solution that is at least as
                             accurate at that obtainable with the
                             &quot;XLT+S&quot; option. Whether the &quot;XCN+S&quot;
                             solution is substantially more accurate
                             depends on the geometry of the
                             participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed.

               Neither case nor white space are significant in
               `abcorr'. For example, the string

                 &quot;Lt + s&quot;

               is valid.

   obsrvr      is the name of the observing body. The observing body is
               an ephemeris object: it typically is a spacecraft, an
               extended body, or a surface point for which ephemeris data
               are available. `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading
               and trailing blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant.
               Optionally, you may supply a string containing the
               integer ID code for the object. For example both
               &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings that indicate
               the Moon is the observer.

               `obsrvr' may be not be identical to `target'.

   spoint      is a surface point on the target body, expressed in
               Cartesian coordinates, relative to the body-fixed
               target frame designated by `fixref'.

               `spoint' need not be visible from the observer's
               location at the epoch `et'.

               The components of `spoint' have units of km.

   trgepc      is the &quot;target surface point epoch.&quot; `trgepc' is defined as
               follows: letting `lt' be the one-way light time between the
               observer and the input surface point `spoint', `trgepc' is
               either the epoch et-lt, et+lt or `et' depending on whether
               the requested aberration correction is, respectively, for
               received radiation, transmitted radiation or omitted. `lt'
               is computed using the method indicated by `abcorr'.

               `trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

   srfvec      is the vector from the observer's position at `et' to
               the aberration-corrected (or optionally, geometric)
               position of `spoint', where the aberration corrections
               are specified by `abcorr'. `srfvec' is expressed in the
               target body-fixed reference frame designated by
               `fixref', evaluated at `trgepc'.

               The components of `srfvec' are given in units of km.

               One can use the CSPICE function <a href="vnorm_c.html">vnorm_c</a> to obtain the
               distance between the observer and `spoint':

                  dist = <a href="vnorm_c.html">vnorm_c</a> ( srfvec );

               The observer's position `obspos', relative to the
               target body's center, where the center's position is
               corrected for aberration effects as indicated by
               `abcorr', can be computed via the call:

                  <a href="vsub_c.html">vsub_c</a> ( spoint, srfvec, obspos );

               To transform the vector `srfvec' from a reference frame
               `fixref' at time `trgepc' to a time-dependent reference frame
               `ref' at `et', the routine <a href="pxfrm2_c.html">pxfrm2_c</a> should be called. For
               example, let `xform' be 3x3 matrix representing the
               rotation from the body-fixed reference frame `fixref' at
               time `trgepc' to the time-dependent frame `ref' at time `et'.
               Then `srfvec' can be transformed to the result `refvec' as
               follows:

                  <a href="pxfrm2_c.html">pxfrm2_c</a> ( fixref, ref,    trgepc, et, xform );
                  <a href="mxv_c.html">mxv_c</a>    ( xform,  srfvec, refvec            );


   The following outputs depend on the existence of a well-defined
   outward normal vector to the surface at `spoint'. See restriction 1.


   phase       is the phase angle at `spoint', as seen from `obsrvr' at time
               `et'. This is the angle between the negative of the vector
               `srfvec' and the spoint-illumination source vector at
               `trgepc'. Units are radians. The range of `phase' is [0, pi].
               See -Particulars below for a detailed discussion of the
               definition.

   incdnc      is the illumination source incidence angle at `spoint', as
               seen from `obsrvr' at time `et'. This is the angle between
               the surface normal vector at `spoint' and the spoint-source
               vector at `trgepc'. Units are radians. The range of `incdnc'
               is [0, pi]. See -Particulars below for a detailed
               discussion of the definition.

   emissn      is the emission angle at `spoint', as seen from `obsrvr' at
               time `et'. This is the angle between the surface normal
               vector at `spoint' and the negative of the vector `srfvec'.
               Units are radians. The range of `emissn' is [0, pi]. See
               -Particulars below for a detailed discussion of the
               definition.

   visibl      is a logical flag indicating whether the surface
               point is visible to the observer. `visibl' takes into
               account whether the target surface occults `spoint',
               regardless of the emission angle at `spoint'. `visibl' is
               returned with the value SPICETRUE if `spoint' is visible;
               otherwise it is SPICEFALSE.

   lit         is a logical flag indicating whether the surface
               point is illuminated; the point is considered to be
               illuminated if the vector from the point to the
               center of the illumination source doesn't intersect
               the target surface. `lit' takes into account whether
               the target surface casts a shadow on `spoint',
               regardless of the incidence angle at `spoint'. `lit' is
               returned with the value SPICETRUE if `spoint' is
               illuminated; otherwise it is SPICEFALSE.

   1)  If the specified aberration correction is relativistic or
       calls for stellar aberration but not light time correction,
       the error SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   2)  If the specified aberration correction is any other
       unrecognized value, an error is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   3)  If any of the target, observer, or illumination source input
       strings cannot be converted to an integer ID code, the error
       SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   4)  If `obsrvr' and `target' map to the same NAIF integer ID code, the
       error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   5)  If the input target body-fixed frame `fixref' is not recognized,
       the error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine. A frame name may fail to be recognized
       because a required frame specification kernel has not been
       loaded; another cause is a misspelling of the frame name.

   6)  If the input frame `fixref' is not centered at the target body,
       the error SPICE(INVALIDFRAME) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   7)  If the input argument `method' cannot be parsed, an error
       is signaled by either this routine or a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   8)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to
       calling <b>illumf_c</b>, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine. Note that when
       light time correction is used, sufficient ephemeris data must
       be available to propagate the states of observer, target, and
       the illumination source to the solar system barycenter.

   9)  If the computation method specifies an ellipsoidal target
       shape and triaxial radii of the target body have not been
       loaded into the kernel pool prior to calling <b>illumf_c</b>, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   10) If PCK data specifying the target body-fixed frame orientation
       have not been loaded prior to calling <b>illumf_c</b>, an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   11) If `method' specifies that the target surface is represented by
       DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for the specified
       target, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   12) If `method' specifies that the target surface is represented by
       DSK data, and data representing the portion of the surface on
       which `spoint' is located are not available, an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   13) If `method' specifies that the target surface is represented
       by DSK data, `spoint' must lie on the target surface, not above
       or below it. A small tolerance is used to allow for round-off
       error in the calculation determining whether `spoint' is on the
       surface.

       If, in the DSK case, `spoint' is too far from the surface, an
       error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

       If the surface is represented by a triaxial ellipsoid, `spoint'
       is not required to be close to the ellipsoid; however, the
       results computed by this routine will be unreliable if `spoint'
       is too far from the ellipsoid.

   14) If radii for `target' are not found in the kernel pool, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   15) If the size of the `target' body radii kernel variable is not
       three, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   16) If any of the three `target' body radii is less-than or equal to
       zero, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   17) If any of the `method', `target', `ilusrc', `fixref', `abcorr'
       or `obsrvr' input string pointers is null, the error
       SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled.

   18) If any of the `method', `target', `ilusrc', `fixref', `abcorr'
       or `obsrvr' input strings has zero length, the error
       SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled.

   Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
   this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: ephemeris data for target, observer, and the
      illumination source must be loaded. If aberration
      corrections are used, the states of target, observer, and
      the illumination source relative to the solar system
      barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris
      data. Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading
      one or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   -  Target body orientation data: these may be provided in a text or
      binary PCK file. In some cases, target body orientation may
      be provided by one more more CK files. In either case, data
      are made available by loading the files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   -  Shape data for the target body:

        PCK data:

           If the target body shape is modeled as an ellipsoid,
           triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded into
           the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a
           text PCK file via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

           Triaxial radii are also needed if the target shape is
           modeled by DSK data, and the DSK NADIR method is
           selected.

        DSK data:

           If the target shape is modeled by DSK data, DSK files
           containing topographic data for the target body must be
           loaded. If a surface list is specified, data for at
           least one of the listed surfaces must be loaded. DSK
           files are loaded via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   The following data may be required:

   -  Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert the
      observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of the
      target, that definition must be available in the kernel
      pool. Typically the definition is supplied by loading a
      frame kernel via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   -  Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified
      in `method', the association of these names with their
      corresponding surface ID codes must be established by
      assignments of the kernel variables

         NAIF_SURFACE_NAME
         NAIF_SURFACE_CODE
         NAIF_SURFACE_BODY

      Normally these associations are made by loading a text
      kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example
      of such assignments is

         NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'
         NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1
         NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499

   -  SCLK data: if the target body's orientation is provided by
      CK files, an associated SCLK kernel must be loaded.


   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

   CSPICE contains four routines that compute illumination angles:

      <b>illumf_c</b> (this routine)

      <a href="illumg_c.html">illumg_c</a> (same as this routine, except that illumination
                and visibility flags are not returned)

                as the illumination source)

      <a href="illum_c.html">illum_c</a>  (deprecated)


   <b>illumf_c</b> is the most capable of the set.


   Illumination angles
   ===================

   The term &quot;illumination angles&quot; refers to the following set of
   angles:


      phase angle              Angle between the vectors from the
                               surface point to the observer and
                               from the surface point to the
                               illumination source.

      incidence angle          Angle between the surface normal at
                               the specified surface point and the
                               vector from the surface point to the
                               illumination source.

      emission angle           Angle between the surface normal at
                               the specified surface point and the
                               vector from the surface point to the
                               observer.

   The diagram below illustrates the geometric relationships
   defining these angles. The labels for the incidence, emission,
   and phase angles are &quot;inc.&quot;, &quot;e.&quot;, and &quot;phase&quot;.


                                                    *

    location           to viewing
    (observer)         location


   Note that if the target-observer vector, the target normal vector
   at the surface point, and the target-illumination source vector
   are coplanar, then phase is the sum of the incidence and emission
   angles. This rarely occurs; usually

      phase angle  &lt;  incidence angle + emission angle

   All of the above angles can be computed using light time
   corrections, light time and stellar aberration corrections, or no
   aberration corrections. In order to describe apparent geometry as
   observed by a remote sensing instrument, both light time and
   stellar aberration corrections should be used.

   The way aberration corrections are applied by this routine
   is described below.

      Light time corrections
      ======================

         Observer-target surface point vector
         ------------------------------------

         Let `et' be the epoch at which an observation or remote
         sensing measurement is made, and let et-lt (&quot;lt&quot; stands
         for &quot;light time&quot;) be the epoch at which the photons
         received at `et' were emitted from the surface point `spoint'.
         Note that the light time between the surface point and
         observer will generally differ from the light time between
         the target body's center and the observer.


         Target body's orientation
         -------------------------

         Using the definitions of `et' and `lt' above, the target body's
         orientation at et-lt is used. The surface normal is
         dependent on the target body's orientation, so the body's
         orientation model must be evaluated for the correct epoch.


         Target body -- illumination source vector
         -----------------------------------------

         The surface features on the target body near `spoint' will
         appear in a measurement made at `et' as they were at et-lt.
         In particular, lighting on the target body is dependent on
         the apparent location of the illumination source as seen
         from the target body at et-lt. So, a second light time
         correction is used to compute the position of the
         illumination source relative to the surface point.


      Stellar aberration corrections
      ==============================

      Stellar aberration corrections are applied only if
      light time corrections are applied as well.

         Observer-target surface point body vector
         -----------------------------------------

         When stellar aberration correction is performed, the
         direction vector `srfvec' is adjusted so as to point to the
         apparent position of `spoint': considering `spoint' to be an
         ephemeris object, `srfvec' points from the observer's
         position at `et' to the light time and stellar aberration
         corrected position of `spoint'.

         Target body-illumination source vector
         --------------------------------------

         The target body-illumination source vector is the apparent
         position of the illumination source, corrected for light
         time and stellar aberration, as seen from the target body
         at time et-lt.


   Using DSK data
   ==============

      DSK loading and unloading
      -------------------------

      DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by
      calling <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="unload_c.html">unload_c</a> or
      <a href="kclear_c.html">kclear_c</a>. See the documentation of <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> for limits on numbers
      of loaded DSK files.

      For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent
      loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to
      use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for
      example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be
      used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be
      used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload
      the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes
      that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a
      given body have different surface ID codes.


      DSK data priority
      -----------------

      A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK
      files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a
      given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time
      intervals of the segments overlap as well.

      When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage
      overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK
      files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes
      precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the
      segment located closer to the end of the file takes
      precedence.

      When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing
      segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments
      both represent a surface as a set of triangular plates, the
      union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the
      surface.

      Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported.
      Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior
      in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is
      required in the `method' argument.


      Syntax of the `method' input argument
      -------------------------------------

      The keywords and surface list in the `method' argument
      are called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may appear in any
      order, for example

         &quot;DSK/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED&quot;
         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;&quot;
         &quot;UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK&quot;

      The simplest form of the `method' argument specifying use of
      DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example:

         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED&quot;

      For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target
      body are for a single surface, and there are no competing
      segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be
      the usual case.

      When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK
      files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the
      surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be
      specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the
      surfaces are to be used together.

      The surface list consists of the string

         &quot;SURFACES =&quot;

      followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface
      identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in
      string format. For example, suppose we have the surface
      names and corresponding ID codes shown below:

         Surface Name                              ID code
         ------------                              -------
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                1
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                 2
         &quot;Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;                         3

      If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then
      data for surface 1 can be specified by either

         &quot;SURFACES = 1&quot;

      or

         &quot;SURFACES = &quot;\&quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;&quot;

      Escaped double quotes are used to delimit the surface name
      because it contains blank characters.

      To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any
      of the following surface lists could be used:

         &quot;SURFACES = 2, 3&quot;

         &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, 3&quot;

         &quot;SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;

         &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;

      An example of a `method' argument that could be constructed
      using one of the surface lists above is

         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, 3&quot;


      Aberration corrections using DSK data
      -------------------------------------

      For irregularly shaped target bodies, the distance between the
      observer and the nearest surface intercept need not be a
      continuous function of time; hence the one-way light time
      between the intercept and the observer may be discontinuous as
      well. In such cases, the computed light time, which is found
      using an iterative algorithm, may converge slowly or not at all.
      In all cases, the light time computation will terminate, but
      the result may be less accurate than expected.

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
   specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) Find the phase, solar incidence, and emission angles at the
      sub-solar and sub-spacecraft points on Mars as seen from the Mars
      Global Surveyor spacecraft at a specified UTC time.

      Use both an ellipsoidal Mars shape model and topographic data
      provided by a DSK file. For both surface points, use the &quot;near
      point&quot; and &quot;nadir&quot; definitions for ellipsoidal and DSK shape
      models, respectively.

      Use converged Newtonian light time and stellar aberration
      corrections.

      The topographic model is based on data from the MGS MOLA DEM
      megr90n000cb, which has a resolution of 4 pixels/degree. A
      triangular plate model was produced by computing a 720 x 1440
      grid of interpolated heights from this DEM, then tessellating
      the height grid. The plate model is stored in a type 2 segment
      in the referenced DSK file.

      kernels.

   1)  Results from this routine are not meaningful if the input
       point lies on a ridge or vertex of a surface represented by
       DSK data, or if for any other reason the direction of the
       outward normal vector at the point is undefined.

   2)  The illumination state indicated by the output argument `lit'
       is computed treating the illumination source as a single
       point. Surface points that are illuminated by part of the
       source are classified as &quot;lit&quot; or not depending on whether the
       center of the source is visible from those points.
