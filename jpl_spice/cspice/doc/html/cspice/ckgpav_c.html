<h4><a name="Detailed_Input">Detailed_Input</a></h4>
<PRE>
   inst        is the NAIF integer ID for the instrument, spacecraft, or
               other structure for which pointing and angular velocity
               are requested. For brevity we will refer to this object
               as the &quot;instrument,&quot; and the frame fixed to this object
               as the &quot;instrument frame&quot; or &quot;instrument-fixed&quot; frame.

   sclkdp      is the encoded spacecraft clock time for which
               pointing and angular velocity are requested.

               The CSPICE routines <a href="scencd_c.html">scencd_c</a> and <a href="sce2c_c.html">sce2c_c</a> respectively
               convert spacecraft clock strings and ephemeris time
               to encoded spacecraft clock. The inverse conversions
               are performed by <a href="scdecd_c.html">scdecd_c</a> and <a href="sct2e_c.html">sct2e_c</a>.

   tol         is a time tolerance in ticks, the units of encoded
               spacecraft clock time.

               The CSPICE routine <a href="sctiks_c.html">sctiks_c</a> converts a spacecraft clock
               tolerance duration from its character string
               representation to ticks. <a href="scfmt_c.html">scfmt_c</a> performs the inverse
               conversion.

               The C-matrix - angular velocity vector pair returned by
               <b>ckgpav_c</b> is the one whose time tag is closest to `sclkdp'
               and within `tol' units of `sclkdp'. (More in
               -Particulars, below.)

               In general, because using a non-zero tolerance
               affects selection of the segment from which the
               data is obtained, users are strongly discouraged
               from using a non-zero tolerance when reading CKs
               with continuous data. Using a non-zero tolerance
               should be reserved exclusively to reading CKs with
               discrete data because in practice obtaining data
               from such CKs using a zero tolerance is often not
               possible due to time round off.

   ref         is the desired reference frame for the returned pointing
               and angular velocity. The returned C-matrix `cmat' gives
               the orientation of the instrument designated by `inst'
               relative to the frame designated by `ref'. When a vector
               specified relative to frame `ref' is left-multiplied by
               `cmat', the vector is rotated to the frame associated
               with `inst'. The returned angular velocity vector `av'
               expresses the angular velocity of the instrument
               designated by `inst' relative to the frame designated by
               `ref'. See the discussion of `cmat' and `av' below
               for details.

               Consult the SPICE document &quot;Frames&quot; for a discussion
               of supported reference frames.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
   cmat        is a rotation matrix that transforms the components of a
               vector expressed in the frame specified by `ref' to
               components expressed in the frame tied to the instrument,
               spacecraft, or other structure at time `clkout' (see
               below).

               Thus, if a vector v has components x,y,z in the `ref'
               reference frame, then v has components x',y',z' in the
               instrument fixed frame at time `clkout':

                  .-   -.     .-        -. .-   -.
                  |  x' |     |          | |  x  |
                  |  y' |  =  |   cmat   | |  y  |
                  |  z' |     |          | |  z  |
                  '-   -'     '-        -' '-   -'

               If you know x', y', z', use the transpose of the
               C-matrix to determine x, y, z as follows:

                  .-   -.      .-        -.T  .-   -.
                  |  x  |      |          |   |  x' |
                  |  y  |  =   |   cmat   |   |  y' |
                  |  z  |      |          |   |  z' |
                  '-   -'      '-        -'   '-   -'

                         (Transpose of `cmat')

   av          is the angular velocity vector. This is the axis about
               which the reference frame tied to the instrument is
               rotating in the right-handed sense at time `clkout'. The
               magnitude of `av' is the magnitude of the instantaneous
               velocity of the rotation, in radians per second.
               The components of `av' are given relative to the
               reference frame specified by the input argument `ref'.

   clkout      is the encoded spacecraft clock time associated with
               the returned C-matrix and the returned angular
               velocity vector. This value may differ from the
               requested time, but never by more than the input
               tolerance `tol'.

               The -Particulars section below describes the search
               algorithm used by <b>ckgpav_c</b> to satisfy a pointing request.
               This algorithm determines the pointing instance
               (and therefore the associated time value) that is
               returned.

   found       is SPICETRUE if a record was found to satisfy the
               pointing request.  `found' will be SPICEFALSE otherwise.

   How the tolerance argument is used
   ==================================


   Reading a type 1 CK segment (discrete pointing instances)
   ---------------------------------------------------------

   In the diagram below

      - &quot;0&quot; is used to represent discrete pointing instances
        (quaternions, angular velocity vectors, and associated
        time tags).

      - &quot;( )&quot; are used to represent the end points of the time
        interval covered by a segment in a CK file.

      - `sclkdp' is the time at which you requested pointing.
        The location of `sclkdp' relative to the time tags of the
        pointing instances is indicated by the &quot;+&quot; sign.

      - `tol' is the time tolerance specified in the pointing
        request. The square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot; represent the
        endpoints of the time interval

           sclkdp-tol : sclkdp+tol

      - The quaternions occurring in the segment need not be
        evenly spaced in time.


   Case 1:  pointing is available
   ------------------------------

                            sclkdp
                                 \   tol
                                  | /
                                  |/\
   Your request                [--+--]
                               .  .  .
   Segment      (0-----0--0--0--0--0--0---0--0------------0--0--0--0)

                                   |
                       <b>ckgpav_c</b> returns this instance.


   Case 2:  pointing is not available
   ----------------------------------

                                                 sclkdp
                                                    \   tol
                                                     | /
                                                     |/\
   Your request                                   [--+--]
                                                  .  .  .
   Segment      (0-----0--0--0--0--0--0---0--0--0---------0--0--0--0)


                       <b>ckgpav_c</b> returns no pointing; the output
                       `found' flag is set to SPICEFALSE.



   Reading a type 2, 3, 4, or 5 CK segment (continuous pointing)
   -------------------------------------------------------------

   In the diagrams below

      - &quot;==&quot; is used to represent periods of continuous pointing.

      - &quot;--&quot; is used to represent gaps in the pointing coverage.

      - &quot;( )&quot; are used to represent the end points of the time
        interval covered by a segment in a CK file.

      - `sclkdp' is the time at which you requested pointing.
        The location of `sclkdp' relative to the time tags of the
        pointing instances is indicated by the &quot;+&quot; sign.

      - `tol' is the time tolerance specified in the pointing
        request. The square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot; represent the
        endpoints of the time interval

           sclkdp-tol : sclkdp+tol

      - The quaternions occurring in the periods of continuous
        pointing need not be evenly spaced in time.


   Case 1:  pointing is available at the request time
   --------------------------------------------------

                           sclkdp
                                 \   tol
                                  | /

                                  |

                 The request time lies within an interval where
                 continuous pointing is available. <b>ckgpav_c</b> returns
                 pointing at the requested epoch.


   Case 2:  pointing is available &quot;near&quot; the request time
   ------------------------------------------------------

                                  sclkdp

                                           |

                 The request time lies in a gap: an interval where
                 continuous pointing is *not* available. <b>ckgpav_c</b>
                 returns pointing for the epoch closest to the
                 request time `sclkdp'.


   Case 3:  pointing is not available
   ----------------------------------

   Tolerance and segment priority
   ==============================

   <b>ckgpav_c</b> searches through loaded C-kernels to satisfy a pointing
   request. Last-loaded files are searched first. Individual files are
   searched in backwards order, so that between competing segments
   (segments containing data for the same object, for overlapping time
   ranges), the one closest to the end of the file has highest
   priority. <b>ckgpav_c</b> considers only those segments that contain both
   pointing and angular velocity data, as indicated by the segment
   descriptor.

   The search ends when a segment is found that can provide pointing
   and angular velocity for the specified instrument at a time
   falling within the specified tolerance on either side of the
   request time. Within that segment, the instance closest to the
   input time is located and returned.

   The following four cases illustrate this search procedure. Segments
   A and B are in the same file, with segment A located further
   towards the end of the file than segment B. Both segments A and B
   contain discrete pointing data, indicated by the number 0.


   Case 1:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
            Because segment A has the highest priority and can
            satisfy the request, segment B is not searched.

   Segments that contain continuous pointing data are searched in the
   same manner as segments containing discrete pointing data. For
   request times that fall within the bounds of continuous intervals,
   <b>ckgpav_c</b> will return pointing at the request time. When the request
   time does not fall within an interval, then a time at an endpoint of
   an interval may be returned if it is the closest time in the segment
   to the user request time and is also within the tolerance.

   In the following examples, segment A is located further towards the
   end of the file than segment C. Segment A contains discrete pointing
   data and segment C contains continuous data, indicated by the &quot;=&quot;
   character.


   Case 3:  Pointing is not available in the first segment searched.
            Because segment A cannot satisfy the request, segment C

   In the next case, assume that the order of segments A and C in the
   file is reversed: A is now closer to the front, so data from
   segment C are considered first.


   Case 4:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.

            satisfy the request, segment A is not searched.

   The next case illustrates an unfortunate side effect of using
   a non-zero tolerance when reading multi-segment CKs with
   continuous data. In all cases when the look-up interval
   formed using tolerance overlaps a segment boundary and
   the request time falls within the coverage of the lower
   priority segment, the data at the end of the higher priority
   segment will be picked instead of the data from the lower
   priority segment.


   Case 5:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
            Because segment C has the highest priority and can
            satisfy the request, segment A is not searched.

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
   specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) The following example program uses <b>ckgpav_c</b> to get C-matrices and
      associated angular velocity vectors for a set of images whose
      SCLK counts (un-encoded character string versions) are known.

      For each C-matrix, a unit pointing vector is constructed and
      printed along with the angular velocity vector.

      Note: if the C-kernels of interest do not contain angular velocity
      data, then the CSPICE routine <a href="ckgp_c.html">ckgp_c</a> should be used to read the
      pointing data. An example program in the header of the CSPICE
      routine <a href="ckgp_c.html">ckgp_c</a> demonstrates this.

      We need to load also an SCLK kernel to convert from clock string
      to &quot;ticks.&quot; Although not required for older spacecraft clocks,
      most modern spacecraft ones require a leapseconds kernel to be
      loaded in addition to an SCLK kernel.


      Use the meta-kernel shown below to load the required SPICE
      kernels.

         This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE

         required by SPICE-based user applications.

         In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
