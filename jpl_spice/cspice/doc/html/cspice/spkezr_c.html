<PRE>
   targ        is the name of a target body. Optionally, you may
               supply the integer ID code for the object as
               an integer string. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and
               &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings that indicate the
               moon is the target body.

               The target and observer define a state vector whose
               position component points from the observer to the
               target.

   et          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past J2000
               TDB, at which the state of the target body relative to
               the observer is to be computed. `et' refers to time at
               the observer's location.

   ref         is the name of the reference frame relative to which
               the output state vector should be expressed. This may
               be any frame supported by the SPICE system, including
               built-in frames (documented in the Frames Required
               Reading) and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel
               (FK).

               When `ref' designates a non-inertial frame, the
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at an epoch
               dependent on the selected aberration correction.
               See the description of the output state vector `starg'
               for details.

   abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
               to the state of the target body to account for one-way
               light time and stellar aberration. See the discussion
               in the -Particulars section for recommendations on
               how to choose aberration corrections.

               `abcorr' may be any of the following:

                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction. Return the
                             geometric state of the target body
                             relative to the observer.

               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at `et':

                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the state of the target at the
                             moment it emitted photons arriving at
                             the observer at `et'.

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation (see -Particulars for details).
                             The solution invoked by the &quot;LT&quot; option
                             uses one iteration.

                  &quot;LT+S&quot;     Correct for one-way light time and
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This option modifies the
                             state obtained with the &quot;LT&quot; option to
                             account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The result is the apparent
                             state of the target---the position and
                             velocity of the target as seen by the
                             observer.

                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates
                             until the solution converges (three
                             iterations on all supported platforms).
                             Whether the &quot;CN+S&quot; solution is
                             substantially more accurate than the
                             &quot;LT&quot; solution depends on the geometry
                             of the participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed. See the -Particulars section
                             below for a discussion of precision of
                             light time corrections.

                  &quot;CN+S&quot;     Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction and stellar aberration
                             correction.


               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et+lt:

                  &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This correction yields the
                             state of the target at the moment it
                             receives photons emitted from the
                             observer's location at `et'.

                  &quot;XLT+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation  This option modifies the
                             state obtained with the &quot;XLT&quot; option to
                             account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The position component of
                             the computed target state indicates the
                             direction that photons emitted from the
                             observer's location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to
                             hit the target.

                  &quot;XCN&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  &quot;XCN+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged Newtonian
                             light time correction and stellar
                             aberration correction.


               Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
               accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
               by this routine.

               Case and blanks are not significant in the string
               `abcorr'.

   obs         is the name of an observing body. Optionally, you may
               supply the ID code of the object as an integer string.
               For example, both &quot;EARTH&quot; and &quot;399&quot; are legitimate
               strings to supply to indicate the observer is
               Earth.

   starg       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position
               and velocity of the target body relative to the
               specified observer. `starg' is corrected for the
               specified aberrations, and is expressed with respect
               to the reference frame specified by `ref'. The first
               three components of `starg' represent the x-, y- and
               z-components of the target's position; the last three
               components form the corresponding velocity vector.

               The position component of `starg' points from the
               observer's location at `et' to the aberration-corrected
               location of the target. Note that the sense of the
               position vector is independent of the direction of
               radiation travel implied by the aberration
               correction.

               The velocity component of `starg' is the derivative
               with respect to time of the position component of
               `starg'.

               Units are always km and km/sec.

               Non-inertial frames are treated as follows: letting
               `ltcent' be the one-way light time between the observer
               and the central body associated with the frame, the
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at et-ltcent,
               et+ltcent, or `et' depending on whether the requested
               aberration correction is, respectively, for received
               radiation, transmitted radiation, or is omitted.
               `ltcent' is computed using the method indicated by
               `abcorr'.

   lt          is the one-way light time between the observer and
               target in seconds. If the target state is corrected
               for aberrations, then `lt' is the one-way light time
               between the observer and the light time corrected
               target location.

   This routine computes states using SPK files that have been
   loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading
   interface routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. See the routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> and the SPK
   and KERNEL Required Reading for further information on loading
   (and unloading) kernels.

   If the output state `starg' is to be expressed relative to a
   non-inertial frame, or if any of the ephemeris data used to
   compute `starg' are expressed relative to a non-inertial frame in
   the SPK files providing those data, additional kernels may be
   needed to enable the reference frame transformations required to
   compute the state. These additional kernels may be C-kernels, PCK
   files or frame kernels. Any such kernels must already be loaded
   at the time this routine is called.

   This routine is part of the user interface to the SPICE ephemeris
   system. It allows you to retrieve state information for any
   ephemeris object relative to any other in a reference frame that
   is convenient for further computations.

   This routine is identical in function to the routine <a href="spkez_c.html">spkez_c</a> except
   that it allows you to refer to ephemeris objects by name (via a
   character string).

   -CSPICE Version 3.0.2, 01-NOV-2021 (JDR)

       Edited the header to comply with NAIF standard. Added reference to the
       required SPK for the example code. Reduced the number of states to be
       computed.

       Moved SPK required reading from -Literature_References to
       -Required_Reading section. Added entries #5 and #6 to -Exceptions
       section.

       Updated -Particulars to refer to Aberration Corrections
       Required Reading document, which was added to
       -Required_Reading list.

   -CSPICE Version 3.0.1, 07-JUL-2014 (NJB)

       Discussion of light time corrections was updated. Assertions
       that converged light time corrections are unlikely to be
       useful were removed.

   -CSPICE Version 3.0.0, 27-DEC-2007 (NJB)

       This routine was upgraded to more accurately compute
       aberration-corrected velocity, and in particular, make it
       more consistent with observer-target positions.

       When light time corrections are used, the derivative of light
       time with respect to time is now accounted for in the
       computation of observer-target velocities. When the reference
       frame associated with the output state is time-dependent, the
       derivative of light time with respect to time is now accounted
       for in the computation of the rate of change of orientation of
       the reference frame.

       When stellar aberration corrections are used, velocities
       now reflect the rate of range of the stellar aberration
       correction.

   -CSPICE Version 2.0.2, 13-OCT-2003 (EDW)

       Added mention that 'lt' returns a value in seconds.

   -CSPICE Version 2.0.1, 29-JUL-2003 (NJB) (CHA)

       Various minor header changes were made to improve clarity.

   -CSPICE Version 2.0.0, 31-DEC-2001 (NJB)

       Updated to handle aberration corrections for transmission
       of radiation. Formerly, only the reception case was
       supported. The header was revised and expanded to explain
       the functionality of this routine in more detail.

   -CSPICE Version 1.2.0, 29-MAY-1999 (NJB) (BVS)

       Comment correction: the name <a href="spkez_c.html">spkez_c</a> was changed to <b>spkezr_c</b>.
