   handle      is the handle of the CK file to which the segment will
               be written. The file must have been opened with write
               access.

   begtim      is the beginning encoded SCLK time of the segment. This
               value should be less than or equal to the first time in
               the segment.

   endtim      is the encoded SCLK time at which the segment ends.
               This value should be greater than or equal to the last
               time in the segment.

   inst        is the NAIF integer ID code for the instrument.

   ref         is a character string which specifies the
               reference frame of the segment. This should be one of
               the frames supported by the SPICELIB routine NAMFRM
               which is an entry point of FRAMEX.

               The rotation matrices represented by the quaternions
               that are to be written to the segment transform the
               components of vectors from the inertial reference frame
               specified by ref to components in the instrument fixed
               frame. Also, the components of the angular velocity
               vectors to be written to the segment should be given
               with respect to ref.

               ref should be the name of one of the frames supported
               by the SPICELIB routine NAMFRM.


   avflag      is a boolean flag which indicates whether or not the
               segment will contain angular velocity.

   segid       is the segment identifier.  A CK segment identifier may
               contain up to 40 characters, excluding the terminating
               null.

   nrec        is the number of pointing instances in the segment.

   sclkdp      are the encoded spacecraft clock times associated with
               each pointing instance. These times must be strictly
               increasing.

   quats       is an array of SPICE-style quaternions representing a
               sequence of C-matrices. See the discussion of &quot;Quaternion
               Styles&quot; in the -Particulars section below.

               The C-matrix represented by the ith quaternion in
               quats is a rotation matrix that transforms the
               components of a vector expressed in the inertial
               frame specified by ref to components expressed in
               the instrument fixed frame at the time sclkdp[i].

               Thus, if a vector V has components x, y, z in the
               inertial frame, then V has components x', y', z' in
               the instrument fixed frame where:

                    [ x' ]     [          ] [ x ]
                    | y' |  =  |   cmat   | | y |
                    [ z' ]     [          ] [ z ]

   avvs        are the angular velocity vectors ( optional ).

               The ith vector in avvs gives the angular velocity of
               the instrument fixed frame at time sclkdp[i]. The
               components of the angular velocity vectors should
               be given with respect to the inertial reference frame
               specified by ref.

               The direction of an angular velocity vector gives
               the right-handed axis about which the instrument fixed
               reference frame is rotating. The magnitude of the
               vector is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity
               of the rotation, in radians per second.

               If avflag is SPICEFALSE then this array is ignored by the
               routine; however it still must be supplied as part of
               the calling sequence.

   nints       is the number of intervals that the pointing instances
               are partitioned into.

   starts      are the start times of each of the interpolation
               intervals. These times must be strictly increasing
               and must coincide with times for which the segment
               contains pointing.

   1)  If `handle' is not the handle of a C-kernel opened for writing,
       an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   2)  If `segid' is more than 40 characters long, the error
       SPICE(SEGIDTOOLONG) is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   3)  If `segid' contains any non-printable characters, the error
       SPICE(NONPRINTABLECHARS) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   4)  If the first encoded SCLK time is negative, the error
       SPICE(INVALIDSCLKTIME) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   5)  If the second encoded SCLK or any subsequent times, or if the
       encoded SCLK times are not strictly increasing, the error
       SPICE(TIMESOUTOFORDER) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   6)  If `begtim' is greater than sclkdp[0] or `endtim' is less than
       sclkdp[nrec-1], the error SPICE(INVALIDDESCRTIME) is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   7)  If the name of the reference frame is not one of those
       supported by the CSPICE routine <a href="namfrm_c.html">namfrm_c</a>, the error
       SPICE(INVALIDREFFRAME) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   8)  If `nrec', the number of pointing records, is less than or equal
       to 0, the error SPICE(INVALIDNUMREC) is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   9)  If `nints', the number of interpolation intervals, is less than
       or equal to 0, the error SPICE(INVALIDNUMINT) is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   10) If the encoded SCLK interval start times are not strictly
       increasing, the error SPICE(TIMESOUTOFORDER) is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   11) If an interval start time does not coincide with a time for
       which there is an actual pointing instance in the segment, the
       error SPICE(INVALIDSTARTTIME) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   12) This routine assumes that the rotation between adjacent
       quaternions that are stored in the same interval has a
       rotation angle of `theta' radians, where

          0  &lt;=  theta  &lt;  pi.

       The routines that evaluate the data in the segment produced
       by this routine cannot distinguish between rotations of `theta'
       radians, where `theta' is in the interval [0, pi), and
       rotations of

          theta   +   2 * k * pi

       radians, where k is any integer. These `large' rotations
       will yield invalid results when interpolated. You must
       ensure that the data stored in the segment will not be
       subject to this sort of ambiguity.

   13) If any quaternion has magnitude zero, the error
       SPICE(ZEROQUATERNION) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   14) If the start time of the first interval and the time of the
       first pointing instance are not the same, the error
       SPICE(TIMESDONTMATCH) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   15) If any of the `ref' or `segid' input string pointers is null,
       the error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled.

   16) If any of the `ref' or `segid' input strings has zero length,
       the error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled.

   Quaternion Styles
   -----------------

   There are different &quot;styles&quot; of quaternions used in
   science and engineering applications. Quaternion styles
   are characterized by

   -  The order of quaternion elements

   -  The quaternion multiplication formula

   -  The convention for associating quaternions
      with rotation matrices

   Two of the commonly used styles are

      - &quot;SPICE&quot;

         &gt; Invented by Sir William Rowan Hamilton
         &gt; Frequently used in mathematics and physics textbooks

      - &quot;Engineering&quot;

         &gt; Widely used in aerospace engineering applications


   CSPICE function interfaces ALWAYS use SPICE quaternions.
   Quaternions of any other style must be converted to SPICE
   quaternions before they are passed to CSPICE functions.


   Relationship between SPICE and Engineering Quaternions
   ------------------------------------------------------

   Let M be a rotation matrix such that for any vector V,

      M*V

   is the result of rotating V by theta radians in the
   counterclockwise direction about unit rotation axis vector A.
   Then the SPICE quaternions representing M are

      (+/-) (  cos(theta/2),
               sin(theta/2) A(1),
               sin(theta/2) A(2),
               sin(theta/2) A(3)  )

   while the engineering quaternions representing M are

      (+/-) ( -sin(theta/2) A(1),
              -sin(theta/2) A(2),
              -sin(theta/2) A(3),
               cos(theta/2)       )

   For both styles of quaternions, if a quaternion q represents
   a rotation matrix M, then -q represents M as well.

   Given an engineering quaternion

      QENG   = ( q0,  q1,  q2,  q3 )

   the equivalent SPICE quaternion is

      QSPICE = ( q3, -q0, -q1, -q2 )


   Associating SPICE Quaternions with Rotation Matrices
   ----------------------------------------------------

   Let FROM and TO be two right-handed reference frames, for
   example, an inertial frame and a spacecraft-fixed frame. Let the
   symbols

      V    ,   V
       FROM     TO

   denote, respectively, an arbitrary vector expressed relative to
   the FROM and TO frames. Let M denote the transformation matrix
   that transforms vectors from frame FROM to frame TO; then

      V   =  M * V
       TO         FROM

   where the expression on the right hand side represents left
   multiplication of the vector by the matrix.

   Then if the unit-length SPICE quaternion q represents M, where

      q = (q0, q1, q2, q3)

   the elements of M are derived from the elements of q as follows:

        .-                                                         -.
        |           2    2                                          |
        | 1 - 2*( q2 + q3 )   2*(q1*q2 - q0*q3)   2*(q1*q3 + q0*q2) |
        |                                                           |
        |                                                           |
        |                               2    2                      |
    M = | 2*(q1*q2 + q0*q3)   1 - 2*( q1 + q3 )   2*(q2*q3 - q0*q1) |
        |                                                           |
        |                                                           |
        |                                                   2    2  |
        | 2*(q1*q3 - q0*q2)   2*(q2*q3 + q0*q1)   1 - 2*( q1 + q2 ) |
        |                                                           |
        `-                                                         -.

   Note that substituting the elements of -q for those of q in the
   right hand side leaves each element of M unchanged; this shows
   that if a quaternion q represents a matrix M, then so does the
   quaternion -q.

   To map the rotation matrix M to a unit quaternion, we start by
   decomposing the rotation matrix as a sum of symmetric
   and skew-symmetric parts:

                                      2
      M = [ I  +  (1-cos(theta)) OMEGA  ] + [ sin(theta) OMEGA ]

                   symmetric                   skew-symmetric


   OMEGA is a skew-symmetric matrix of the form

                 .-             -.
                 |  0   -n3   n2 |
                 |               |
       OMEGA  =  |  n3   0   -n1 |
                 |               |
                 | -n2   n1   0  |
                 `-             -'

   The vector N of matrix entries (n1, n2, n3) is the rotation axis
   of M and theta is M's rotation angle. Note that N and theta
   are not unique.

   Let

      C = cos(theta/2)
      S = sin(theta/2)

   Then the unit quaternions Q corresponding to M are

      Q = +/- ( C, S*n1, S*n2, S*n3 )

   The mappings between quaternions and the corresponding rotations
   are carried out by the CSPICE routines

      <a href="q2m_c.html">q2m_c</a> {quaternion to matrix}
      <a href="m2q_c.html">m2q_c</a> {matrix to quaternion}

   <a href="m2q_c.html">m2q_c</a> always returns a quaternion with scalar part greater than
   or equal to zero.


   SPICE Quaternion Multiplication Formula
   ---------------------------------------

   Given a SPICE quaternion

      Q = ( q0, q1, q2, q3 )

   corresponding to rotation axis A and angle theta as above, we can
   represent Q using &quot;scalar + vector&quot; notation as follows:

      s =   q0           = cos(theta/2)

      v = ( q1, q2, q3 ) = sin(theta/2) * A

      Q = s + v

   Let Q1 and Q2 be SPICE quaternions with respective scalar
   and vector parts s1, s2 and v1, v2:

      Q1 = s1 + v1
      Q2 = s2 + v2

   We represent the dot product of v1 and v2 by

      &lt;v1, v2&gt;

   and the cross product of v1 and v2 by

      v1 x v2

   Then the SPICE quaternion product is

      Q1*Q2 = s1*s2 - &lt;v1,v2&gt;  + s1*v2 + s2*v1 + (v1 x v2)

   If Q1 and Q2 represent the rotation matrices M1 and M2
   respectively, then the quaternion product

      Q1*Q2

   represents the matrix product

      M1*M2

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
   specific arithmetic implementation.

<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>
<PRE>
   1)  The creator of the segment is given the responsibility for
       determining whether it is reasonable to interpolate between
       two given pointing values.

   2)  This routine assumes that the rotation between adjacent
       quaternions that are stored in the same interval has a
       rotation angle of THETA radians, where

           0  &lt;=  THETA  &lt;  pi.

       The routines that evaluate the data in the segment produced
       by this routine cannot distinguish between rotations of THETA
       radians, where THETA is in the interval [0, pi), and
       rotations of

           THETA   +   2 * k * pi

       radians, where k is any integer. These &quot;large&quot; rotations will
       yield invalid results when interpolated. You must ensure that
       the data stored in the segment will not be subject to this
       sort of ambiguity.

   3)  All pointing instances in the segment must belong to one and
       only one of the intervals.
