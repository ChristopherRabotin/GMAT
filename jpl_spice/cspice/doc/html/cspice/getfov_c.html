   instid      is the NAIF ID of an instrument.

   room        is the maximum number of 3-dimensional vectors that can
               be returned in `bounds'.

   shapelen    is the maximum allowed length of the output string
               `shape'. This length must be large enough to hold the
               output string plus the null-terminator character. If the
               output string is expected to have X characters, `shapelen'
               should be at least X+1.

   framelen    is the maximum allowed length of the output string
               `frame'. This length must be large enough to hold the
               output string plus the null-terminator character. If the
               output string is expected to have X characters, `framelen'
               should be at least X+1.
</PRE>

<PRE>
   shape       is a character string that describes the &quot;shape&quot; of
               the field of view. Possible values returned are:

                  &quot;POLYGON&quot;
                  &quot;RECTANGLE&quot;
                  &quot;CIRCLE&quot;
                  &quot;ELLIPSE&quot;

               If the value of `shape' is &quot;POLYGON&quot; the field of view
               of the instrument is a pyramidal polyhedron. The
               vertex of the pyramid is at the instrument focal
               point. The rays along the edges of the pyramid are
               parallel to the vectors returned in `bounds'.

               If the value of `shape' is &quot;RECTANGLE&quot; the field of view
               of the instrument is a rectangular pyramid. The vertex
               of the pyramid is at the instrument focal point. The
               rays along the edges of the pyramid are parallel to
               the vectors returned in `bounds'. Moreover, in this
               case, the boresight points along the axis of symmetry
               of the rectangular pyramid.

               If the value of `shape' is &quot;CIRCLE&quot; the field of view of
               the instrument is a circular cone centered on the
               boresight vector. The vertex of the cone is at the
               instrument focal point. A single vector will be
               returned in `bounds'. This vector will be parallel to a
               ray that lies in the cone that makes up the boundary
               of the field of view.

               If the value of `shape' is &quot;ELLIPSE&quot; the field of view
               of the instrument is an elliptical cone with the
               boresight vector as the axis of the cone. In this
               case two vectors are returned in `bounds'. One of the
               vectors returned in `bounds' points to the end of the
               semi-major axis of a perpendicular cross section of
               the elliptic cone. The other vector points to the end
               of the semi-minor axis of a perpendicular cross
               section of the cone.

   frame       is the name of the reference frame in which the field
               of view boundary vectors are defined.

   bsight      is a vector representing the principal instrument view
               direction that can be

                  -  the central pixel view direction,
                  -  the optical axis direction,
                  -  the FOV geometric center view direction,
                  -  an axis of the FOV frame,

               or any other vector specified for this purpose
               in the IK FOV definition. The length of `bsight'
               is not specified other than being non-zero.

   n           is the number of boundary vectors returned.

   bounds      is an array of vectors that point to the &quot;corners&quot; of
               the instrument field of view. (See the discussion
               accompanying `shape' for an expansion of the term
               &quot;corner of the field of view.&quot;) Note that the vectors
               returned in `bounds' are not necessarily unit vectors.
               Their magnitudes will be as set in the IK (for
               'CORNERS'-style FOV specifications) or the same as the
               magnitude of the boresight (for 'ANGLES'-style FOV
               specifications.)

   MINCOS      This parameter is the lower limit on the value of the
               cosine of the cross or reference angles in the 'ANGLES'
               specification cases (see -Particulars for further
               discussion). The parameter and its current value,
               1.0x10^(-15), are employed in the C code derived from the
               Fortran version of GETFOV that this wrapper invokes.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4>
<PRE>
   1)  If the frame associated with the instrument can not be found,
       the error SPICE(FRAMEMISSING) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   2)  If the shape of the instrument field of view can not be found
       in the kernel pool, the error SPICE(SHAPEMISSING) is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine signaled.

   3)  If the FOV_SHAPE specified by the instrument kernel is not one
       of the four values: 'CIRCLE', 'POLYGON', 'ELLIPSE', or
       'RECTANGLE', the error SPICE(SHAPENOTSUPPORTED) is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine. If the 'ANGLES'
       specification is used, FOV_SHAPE must be one of the three
       values: 'CIRCLE', 'ELLIPSE', or 'RECTANGLE'.

   4)  If the direction of the boresight cannot be located in the
       kernel pool, the error SPICE(BORESIGHTMISSING) is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   5)  If the number of components for the boresight vector in the
       kernel pool is not 3, or they are not numeric, the error
       SPICE(BADBORESIGHTSPEC) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   6)  If the boresight vector is the zero vector, the error 
       SPICE(ZEROBORESIGHT) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   7)  If the 'ANGLES' specification is not present in the kernel
       pool and the boundary vectors for the edge of the field of
       view cannot be found in the kernel pool, the error
       SPICE(BOUNDARYMISSING) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   8)  If there is insufficient room (as specified by the argument
       `room') to return all of the vectors associated with the
       boundary of the field of view, the error SPICE(BOUNDARYTOOBIG)
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   9)  If the number of components of vectors making up the field of
       view is not a multiple of 3, the error SPICE(BADBOUNDARY) is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   10) If the number of components of vectors making up the field of
       view is not compatible with the shape specified for the field
       of view, the error SPICE(BADBOUNDARY) is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   11) If the reference vector for the 'ANGLES' specification can not
       be found in the kernel pool, the error SPICE(REFVECTORMISSING)
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   12) If the reference vector stored in the kernel pool to support
       the 'ANGLES' specification contains an incorrect number of
       components, contains 3 character components, or is parallel to
       the boresight, the error SPICE(BADREFVECTORSPEC) is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   13) If the 'ANGLES' specification is present in the kernel pool
       and the reference angle stored in the kernel pool to support
       the 'ANGLES' specification is absent from the kernel pool, the
       error SPICE(REFANGLEMISSING) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   14) If the keyword that stores the angular units for the angles
       used in the 'ANGLES' specification is absent from the kernel
       pool, the error SPICE(UNITSMISSING) is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   15) If the value used for the units in the 'ANGLES' specification
       is not one of the supported angular units of <a href="convrt_c.html">convrt_c</a>, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   16) If the keyword that stores the cross angle for the 'ANGLES'
       specification is needed and is absent from the kernel pool,
       the error SPICE(CROSSANGLEMISSING) is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   17) If the angles for the 'RECTANGLE'/'ANGLES' specification case
       have cosines that are less than those stored in the parameter
       MINCOS, the error SPICE(BADBOUNDARY) is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   18) If the class specification contains something other than
       'ANGLES' or 'CORNERS', the error SPICE(UNSUPPORTEDSPEC) is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   19) In the event that the CLASS_SPEC keyword is absent from the
       kernel pool for the instrument whose FOV is sought, this
       module assumes the 'CORNERS' specification is to be utilized.

   20) If any of the `shape' or `frame' output string pointers is
       null, the error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled.

   21) If any of the `shape' or `frame' output strings has length
       less than two characters, the error SPICE(STRINGTOOSHORT) is
       signaled, since the output string is too short to contain one
       character of output data plus a null terminator.

   This routine relies upon having successfully loaded an instrument
   kernel (IK file) via the routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> prior to calling this
   routine.

<h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4>
<PRE>
   This routine provides a common interface for retrieving from the
   kernel pool the geometric characteristics of an instrument field
   of view for a wide variety of remote sensing instruments
   across many different space missions.

   Given the NAIF instrument ID, (and having &quot;loaded&quot; the
   instrument field of view description via the routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>)
   this routine returns the boresight of the instrument, the
   &quot;shape&quot; of the field of view, a collection of vectors
   that point along the edges of the field of view, and the
   name of the reference frame in which these vectors are defined.

   Currently this routine supports two classes of specifications
   for FOV definitions: &quot;corners&quot; and &quot;angles&quot;.

   The &quot;corners&quot; specification requires that the following keywords
   defining the shape, boresight, boundary vectors, and reference
   frame of the FOV be provided in one of the text kernel files
   (normally an IK file) loaded into the kernel pool (in the
   keywords below &lt;INSTID&gt; is replaced with the instrument ID as
   passed into the module):

      INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_CLASS_SPEC         must be set to 'CORNERS' or
                                         omitted to indicate the
                                         &quot;corners&quot;-class
                                         specification.

      INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_SHAPE              must be set to one of these
                                         values:

                                            'CIRCLE'
                                            'ELLIPSE'
                                            'RECTANGLE'
                                            'POLYGON'

      INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_FRAME              must contain the name of
                                         the frame in which the
                                         boresight and boundary
                                         corner vectors are defined.

      INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_BORESIGHT              must be set to a 3D vector
                                         defining the boresight in
                                         the FOV frame specified in
                                         the FOV_FRAME keyword.

      INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_BOUNDARY   or
      INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_BOUNDARY_CORNERS   must be set to one (for
                                         FOV_SHAPE = 'CIRCLE'), two
                                         (for FOV_SHAPE =
                                         'ELLIPSE'), four (for
                                         FOV_SHAPE = 'RECTANGLE'),
                                         or three or more (for
                                         'POLYGON') 3D vectors
                                         defining the corners of the
                                         FOV in the FOV frame
                                         specified in the FOV_FRAME
                                         keyword. The vectors should
                                         be listed in either
                                         clockwise or
                                         counterclockwise order.
                                         This is required by some
                                         SPICE routines that make
                                         use of FOV specifications.

   The &quot;angles&quot; specification requires the following keywords
   defining the shape, boresight, reference vector, reference and
   cross angular extents of the FOV be provided in one of the text
   kernel files (normally an IK file) loaded into the kernel
   pool (in the keywords below &lt;INSTID&gt; is replaced with the

                                         recognized by <a href="convrt_c.html">convrt_c</a> are
                                         acceptable.

   The INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_REF_ANGLE and INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_CROSS_ANGLE
   keywords can have any values for the 'CIRCLE' and 'ELLIPSE'
   FOV shapes but must satisfy the condition cos( angle ) &gt; 0 for
   the 'RECTANGLE' shape.

   This routine is intended to be an intermediate level routine.
   It is expected that users of this routine will be familiar
   with the SPICE frames subsystem and will be comfortable writing
   software to further manipulate the vectors retrieved by this
   routine.

   -CSPICE Version 1.1.0, 17-DEC-2021 (JDR) (NJB)

       Bug fix: now this function does not attempt to modify the output
       strings `shape' and `frame' if the call to the f2c'd routine getfov_
       fails. For safety, in this failure case, a null is placed in the
       first character of each string.

       Bug fix: added missing exception for the boresight vector
       being the zero vector.

       Edited the header to comply with NAIF standard.

       Updated -Particulars to describe the actual condition that
       reference and cross angles values must satisfy.

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.6, 22-MAR-2017 (JDR) (BVS)

      Header updates: made various header changes to make it
      compliant with the SPICE standard header format; updated
      BSIGHT description; added explanation of output boundary
      vector magnitudes; made other minor header corrections.

      Added call to <a href="return_c.html">return_c</a> as part of the error tracing.

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.5, 05-FEB-2009 (BVS)

      Header update: added information about required IK keywords;
      replaced old example with a new one more focused on <b>getfov_c</b> and
      IK keywords.

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.4, 27-OCT-2005 (NJB)

      Header update: replaced reference to <a href="bodvar_c.html">bodvar_c</a> with
      reference to <a href="bodvcd_c.html">bodvcd_c</a>.

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.3, 28-DEC-2004 (BVS)

      Fixed typo in the header example.

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.2, 29-JUL-2003 (NJB) (CHA)

      Various header changes were made to improve clarity. Some
      minor header corrections were made.

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.1, 18-DEC-2001 (FST)

      Updated the header of this wrapper to document the changes
      in GETFOV regarding the addition of support for the ANGLES
      specification.
