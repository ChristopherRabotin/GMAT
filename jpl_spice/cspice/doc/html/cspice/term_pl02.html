   handle      is the DAS file handle of a DSK file open for read
               access. This kernel must contain a type 2 segment
               that provides a plate model representing the entire
               surface of the target body.

   dladsc      is the DLA descriptor of a DSK segment representing
               the surface of a target body.

   trmtyp      is a string indicating the type of terminator to
               compute: umbral or penumbral. The umbral terminator is
               the boundary of the portion of the target surface in
               total shadow. The penumbral terminator is the boundary
               of the portion of the surface that is completely
               illuminated. Note that in astronomy references, the
               unqualified word &quot;terminator&quot; refers to the umbral
               terminator. Here, the unqualified word refers to either
               type of terminator.

               To compute the terminator points, this routine first
               computes a set of points on the terminator of the
               indicated type on the surface of a reference ellipsoid
               for the target body. Each such point defines the
               direction of a ray emanating from the target center and
               associated with a terminator point on the actual surface
               defined by the plate model. The outermost surface
               intercept of each such ray is a considered to be a
               terminator point of the surface defined by the plate
               model.

               Possible values of `trmtyp' are

                  &quot;UMBRAL&quot;
                  &quot;PENUMBRAL&quot;

               Case and leading or trailing blanks in `trmtyp' are
               not significant.

   source      is the name of the body acting as a light source.
               `source' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
               blanks in `target' are not significant. Optionally, you
               may supply a string containing the integer ID code
               for the object. For example both &quot;SUN&quot; and &quot;10&quot; are
               legitimate strings that indicate the Sun is the light
               source.

               This routine assumes that a kernel variable
               representing the light source's radii is present in
               the kernel pool. Normally the kernel variable would
               be defined by loading a PCK file.

               The shape of the light source is always modeled as a
               sphere, regardless of whether radii defining a
               triaxial ellipsoidal shape model are available in the
               kernel pool. The maximum radius of the body is used
               as the radius of the sphere.

   target      is the name of the target body. `target' is
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
               `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may supply
               a string containing the integer ID code for the object.
               For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings
               that indicate the moon is the target body.

               This routine assumes that a kernel variable representing
               the target's radii is present in the kernel pool.
               Normally the kernel variable would be defined by loading
               a PCK file.

   et          is the epoch of participation of the observer,
               expressed as ephemeris seconds past J2000 TDB: `et' is
               the epoch at which the observer's position is
               computed.

               When aberration corrections are not used, `et' is also
               the epoch at which the position and orientation of the
               target body and position of the light source are
               computed.

               When aberration corrections are used, `et' is the epoch
               at which the observer's position relative to the solar
               system barycenter is computed; in this case the
               position and orientation of the target body are
               computed at et-lt or et+lt, where `lt' is the one-way
               light time between the target body's center and the
               observer, and the sign applied to `lt' depends on the
               selected correction. See the description of `abcorr'
               below for details.

   fixref      is the name of the reference frame relative to which
               the output terminator points are expressed. This must
               a body-centered, body-fixed frame associated with the
               target. The frame's axes must be compatible with the
               triaxial ellipsoidal shape model associated with the
               target body (normally provide via a PCK): this
               routine assumes that the first, second, and third
               axis lengths correspond, respectively, to the x, y,
               and z-axes of the frame designated by `fixref'.

               `fixref' may refer to a built-in frame (documented in
               the Frames Required Reading) or a frame defined by a
               loaded frame kernel (FK).

               The orientation of the frame designated by `fixref' is
               evaluated at epoch of participation of the target
               body. See the descriptions of `et' and `abcorr' for
               details.

   abcorr      indicates the aberration correction to be applied
               when computing the observer-target position, the
               orientation of the target body, and the target-
               source position vector.  `abcorr' may be any of
               the following.

                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction. Compute the
                             terminator points using the position
                             of the light source and target, and
                             the orientation of the target, at `et'.

               Let `lt' represent the one-way light time between the
               observer and the target body's center. The following
               values of `abcorr' apply to the &quot;reception&quot; case in
               which photons depart from the target body's center at
               the light-time corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at
               the observer's location at `et':


                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the location of the terminator
                             points at the approximate time they
                             emitted photons arriving at the
                             observer at `et' (the difference between
                             light time to the target center and
                             light time to the terminator points
                             is ignored).

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation. The solution invoked by the
                             &quot;LT&quot; option uses one iteration.

                             The target position as seen by the
                             observer, the position of the light
                             source as seen from the target at
                             et-lt, and the rotation of the target
                             body, are corrected for light time.

                  'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This option modifies the
                             positions obtained with the &quot;LT&quot; option
                             to account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. This correction also
                             applies to the position of the light
                             source relative to the target. The
                             result is the apparent terminator as
                             seen by the observer.

                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates
                             until the solution converges. The
                             position and rotation of the target
                             body and the position of the light
                             source relative to the target are
                             corrected for light time.

                  'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                             and stellar aberration corrections.

   obsrvr      is the name of the observing body. This is typically
               a spacecraft, the Earth, or a surface point on the
               Earth.  `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and
               trailing blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant.
               Optionally, you may supply a string containing the
               integer ID code for the object. For example both
               &quot;EARTH&quot; and &quot;399&quot; are legitimate strings that indicate
               the Earth is the observer.

   npts        is the number of terminator points to compute.

   trgepc      is the &quot;target epoch.&quot;  `trgepc' is defined as follows:
               letting `lt' be the one-way light time between the
               target center and observer, `trgepc' is either the
               epoch et-lt or `et' depending on whether the requested
               aberration correction is, respectively, for received
               radiation or omitted. `lt' is computed using the
               method indicated by `abcorr'.

               `trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.


   obspos      is the vector from the center of the target body at
               epoch `trgepc' to the observer at epoch `et'.  `obspos' is
               expressed in the target body-fixed reference frame
               `fixref', which is evaluated at `trgepc'.

               `obspos' is returned to simplify various related
               computations that would otherwise be cumbersome. For
               example, the vector `xvec' from the observer to the
               Ith terminator point can be calculated via the call

                  <a href="vminus_c.html">vminus_c</a> ( trmpts[i], obspos, xvec );

               The components of `obspos' are given in units of km.


   trmpts      is an array of points on the umbral or penumbral
               terminator of the target, as specified by the input
               argument `trmtyp'. The ith point is contained in the
               array elements

                   trmpts[i][j],  j = 0, 1, 2

               As described above, each terminator point lies on a ray
               emanating from the center of the target and passing
               through a terminator point on the target's reference
               ellipsoid. Each terminator point *on the reference
               ellipsoid* is the point of tangency of a plane that is
               also tangent to the light source. These associated
               points of tangency on the light source have uniform
               distribution in longitude when expressed in a
               cylindrical coordinate system whose Z-axis is the
               target-source vector. The magnitude of the separation in
               longitude between the tangency points on the light
               source is

                  2*Pi / npts

               If the reference ellipsoid for the target is spherical,
               the terminator points also are uniformly distributed in
               longitude in the cylindrical system described above. If
               the reference ellipsoid of the target is non-spherical,
               the longitude distribution of the points generally is
               not uniform.

               The terminator points are expressed in the body-fixed
               reference frame designated by `fixref'. Units are km.


   pltids      is an array of integer ID codes of the plates on which
               the terminator points are located. The ith plate ID
               corresponds to the ith terminator point. These ID codes can
               be use to look up data associated with the plate, such
               as the plate's vertices or outward normal vector.

               `pltids' should be declared by the caller

   Appropriate DSK, SPK, PCK, and frame kernels must be loaded by the
   calling program before this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  DSK data:  a DSK file containing a plate model representing the
      target body's surface must be loaded. This kernel must contain
      a type 2 segment that contains data for the entire surface of
      the target body.

   -  SPK data: ephemeris data for target, observer, and light
      source must be loaded. If aberration corrections are used,
      the states of all three objects relative to the solar system
      barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris
      data. Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading
      one or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   -  PCK data: triaxial radii for the target body and
      the light source must be loaded into the kernel pool.
      Typically this is done by loading a text PCK file via
      <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   -  Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must
      be loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK
      file.

   -  Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert
      the observer and target states to the target body-fixed
      frame designated by `fixref', that definition must be
      available in the kernel pool. Typically the definitions of
      frames not already built-in to SPICE are supplied by loading
      a frame kernel.

   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

   In this routine, we use the term &quot;umbral terminator&quot; to denote
   the curve usually called the &quot;terminator&quot;:  this curve is the
   boundary of the portion of the target body's surface that lies in
   total shadow. We use the term &quot;penumbral terminator&quot; to denote
   the boundary of the completely illuminated portion of the
   surface.

   Boundaries of illuminated regions on an arbitrary surface are often
   complicated point sets: boundaries of shadows of mountains and
   craters, if present, all contribute to the overall set. To make the
   terminator computation tractable, we simplify the problem by using a
   reference ellipsoid for guidance. We compute a set of terminator
   points on the reference ellipsoid for the target body, then use
   those points to define the latitudes and longitudes of terminator
   points on the surface defined by the specified triangular shape
   model. As such, the set of terminator points found by this routine
   is just an approximation.

   Below we discuss the computation of terminator points on the target
   body's reference ellipsoid.

   This routine assumes a spherical light source. Light rays are
   assumed to travel along straight lines; refraction is not modeled.

   Points on the reference ellipsoid at which the entire cap of
   the light source is visible are considered to be completely
   illuminated. Points on the ellipsoid at which some portion
   (or all) of the cap of the light source are blocked are
   considered to be in partial (or total) shadow.

   In general, the terminator on an ellipsoid is a more complicated
   curve than the limb (which is always an ellipse).  Aside from
   various special cases, the terminator does not lie in a plane.

   However, the condition for a point X on the ellipsoid to lie on
   the terminator is simple:  a plane tangent to the ellipsoid at X
   must also be tangent to the light source. If this tangent plane
   does not intersect the vector from the center of the ellipsoid to
   the center of the light source, then X lies on the umbral
   terminator; otherwise X lies on the penumbral terminator.

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input,
   the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine specific
   arithmetic implementation.

   1) Compute sets of umbral and penumbral terminator points on Phobos
      as seen from Mars. Perform a consistency check using the solar
      incidence angle at each point, where the solar incidence angle
      is computed using both a reference ellipsoid and the actual
      plate model surface and surface normal. We expect to see a
      solar incidence angle of approximately 90 degrees. Since the
      solar incidence angle is measured between the local outward
      normal and the direction to the Sun, the solar incidence angle
      at an umbral or penumbral terminator point should be,
      respectively, greater than or less than 90 degrees by
      approximately the angular radius of the Sun as seen from each
      terminator point.

   -CSPICE Version 1.1.0, 26-OCT-2021 (JDR)

       Changed the argument names &quot;npoints&quot; and &quot;plateIDs&quot; to &quot;npts&quot; and
       &quot;pltids&quot; for consistency with other routines.

       Edited the header to comply with NAIF standard.

       Index lines now state that this routine is deprecated.

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.0, 22-FEB-2017 (NJB)

       Include file references have been updated. Integer output
       format in the example program has been updated.

       An error in the Detailed_Output header section was corrected.
       The text now states that the central axis of the cylindrical
       system is the target-source vector.

       29-APR-2014 (NJB)

          Bug fix: added <a href="chkout_c.html">chkout_c</a> call after call to edterm_.

          Bug fix: corrected module name used in check-in and
          check-out calls.

          Bug fix: added error handling for null input string
          pointers and empty strings.

          Changed name of argument `fixfrm' to `fixref'.

       14-MAY-2010 (NJB)

          Updated kernels in example program.

       12-FEB-2010 (NJB)

          This routine now calls the CSPICE routine

             edterm_

          instead of

             edterm_pl02__

          This routine was updated to include

             SpiceDSK.h
             pl02.h

          The header example has been updated to use current
          planetary and satellite SPK files.
