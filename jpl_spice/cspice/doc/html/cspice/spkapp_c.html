   targ        is the NAIF ID code for a target body. The target
               and observer define a state vector whose position
               component points from the observer to the target.

   et          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past J2000
               TDB, at which the state of the target body relative to
               the observer is to be computed. `et' refers to time at
               the observer's location.

   ref         is the inertial reference frame with respect to which
               the observer's state `sobs' is expressed. `ref' must be
               recognized by the SPICE Toolkit. The acceptable
               frames are listed in the Frames Required Reading, as
               well as in the SPICELIB routine CHGIRF.

               Case and blanks are not significant in the string `ref'.

   sobs        is the geometric (uncorrected) state of the observer
               relative to the solar system barycenter at epoch `et'.
               `sobs' is a 6-vector:  the first three components of
               `sobs' represent a Cartesian position vector; the last
               three components represent the corresponding velocity
               vector. `sobs' is expressed relative to the inertial
               reference frame designated by `ref'.

               Units are always km and km/sec.

   abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
               to the state of the target body to account for one-way
               light time and stellar aberration. See the discussion
               in the -Particulars section for recommendations on
               how to choose aberration corrections.

               `abcorr' may be any of the following:

                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction. Return the
                             geometric state of the target body
                             relative to the observer.

               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at `et':

                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the state of the target at the
                             moment it emitted photons arriving at
                             the observer at `et'.

                             The light time correction involves
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation (see -Particulars for details).
                             The solution invoked by the &quot;LT&quot; option
                             uses one iteration.

                  &quot;LT+S&quot;     Correct for one-way light time and
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This option modifies the
                             state obtained with the &quot;LT&quot; option to
                             account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The result is the apparent
                             state of the target---the position and
                             velocity of the target as seen by the
                             observer.

                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates
                             until the solution converges (three
                             iterations on all supported platforms).
                             Whether the &quot;CN+S&quot; solution is
                             substantially more accurate than the
                             &quot;LT&quot; solution depends on the geometry
                             of the participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed. See the -Particulars section
                             of <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> for a discussion of precision
                             of light time corrections.

               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et+lt:

                  &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This correction yields the
                             state of the target at the moment it
                             receives photons emitted from the
                             observer's location at `et'.

                  &quot;XLT+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation  This option modifies the
                             state obtained with the &quot;XLT&quot; option to
                             account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The position component of
                             the computed target state indicates the
                             direction that photons emitted from the
                             observer's location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to
                             hit the target.

                  &quot;XCN&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  &quot;XCN+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction and
                             stellar aberration correction.

               Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
               accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
               by this routine.

<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>

   starg       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position
               and velocity of the target body relative to the
               specified observer. `starg' is corrected for the
               specified aberrations, and is expressed with respect
               to the specified inertial reference frame. The first
               three components of `starg' represent the x-, y- and
               z-components of the target's position; last three
               components form the corresponding velocity vector.

               The position component of `starg' points from the
               observer's location at `et' to the aberration-corrected
               location of the target. Note that the sense of the
               position vector is independent of the direction of
               radiation travel implied by the aberration
               correction.

               The velocity component of `starg' is obtained by
               evaluating the target's geometric state at the light
               time corrected epoch, so for aberration-corrected
               states, the velocity is not precisely equal to the
               time derivative of the position.

               Units are always km and km/sec.

   lt          is the one-way light time between the observer and
               target in seconds. If the target state is corrected
               for aberrations, then `lt' is the one-way light time
               between the observer and the light time corrected
               target location.

   This routine computes states using SPK files that have been
   loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading
   interface routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. Application programs typically load
   kernels once before this routine is called, for example during
   program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly.
   See the routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading
   for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels.

   If any of the ephemeris data used to compute `starg' are expressed
   relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those
   data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference
   frame transformations required to compute the state. Normally
   these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels. Any
   such kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is
   called.

   In space science or engineering applications one frequently
   wishes to know where to point a remote sensing instrument, such
   as an optical camera or radio antenna, in order to observe or
   otherwise receive radiation from a target. This pointing problem
   is complicated by the finite speed of light: one needs to point
   to where the target appears to be as opposed to where it actually
   is at the epoch of observation. We use the adjectives
   &quot;geometric,&quot; &quot;uncorrected,&quot; or &quot;true&quot; to refer to an actual
   position or state of a target at a specified epoch. When a
   geometric position or state vector is modified to reflect how it
   appears to an observer, we describe that vector by any of the
   terms &quot;apparent,&quot; &quot;corrected,&quot; &quot;aberration corrected,&quot; or &quot;light
   time and stellar aberration corrected.&quot;

   The SPICE Toolkit can correct for two phenomena affecting the
   apparent location of an object: one-way light time (also called
   &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) and stellar aberration. Correcting for
   one-way light time is done by computing, given an observer and
   observation epoch, where a target was when the observed photons
   departed the target's location. The vector from the observer to
   this computed target location is called a &quot;light time corrected&quot;
   vector. The light time correction depends on the motion of the
   target, but it is independent of the velocity of the observer
   relative to the solar system barycenter. Relativistic effects
   such as light bending and gravitational delay are not accounted
   for in the light time correction performed by this routine.

   The velocity of the observer also affects the apparent location
   of a target: photons arriving at the observer are subject to a
   &quot;raindrop effect&quot; whereby their velocity relative to the observer
   is, using a Newtonian approximation, the photons' velocity
   relative to the solar system barycenter minus the velocity of the
   observer relative to the solar system barycenter. This effect is
   called &quot;stellar aberration.&quot; Stellar aberration is independent
   of the velocity of the target. The stellar aberration formula
   used by this routine is non-relativistic.

   Stellar aberration corrections are applied after light time
   corrections: the light time corrected target position vector is
   used as an input to the stellar aberration correction.

   When light time and stellar aberration corrections are both
   applied to a geometric position vector, the resulting position
   vector indicates where the target &quot;appears to be&quot; from the
   observer's location.

   As opposed to computing the apparent position of a target, one
   may wish to compute the pointing direction required for
   transmission of photons to the target. This requires correction
   of the geometric target position for the effects of light time and
   stellar aberration, but in this case the corrections are computed
   for radiation traveling from the observer to the target.

   The &quot;transmission&quot; light time correction yields the target's
   location as it will be when photons emitted from the observer's
   location at `et' arrive at the target. The transmission stellar
   aberration correction is the inverse of the traditional stellar
   aberration correction: it indicates the direction in which
   radiation should be emitted so that, using a Newtonian
   approximation, the sum of the velocity of the radiation relative
   to the observer and of the observer's velocity, relative to the
   solar system barycenter, yields a velocity vector that points in
   the direction of the light time corrected position of the target.

   The traditional aberration corrections applicable to observation
   and those applicable to transmission are related in a simple way:
   one may picture the geometry of the &quot;transmission&quot; case by
   imagining the &quot;observation&quot; case running in reverse time order,
   and vice versa.

   One may reasonably object to using the term &quot;observer&quot; in the
   transmission case, in which radiation is emitted from the
   observer's location. The terminology was retained for
   consistency with earlier documentation.

   Below, we indicate the aberration corrections to use for some
   common applications:

      1) Find the apparent direction of a target for a remote-sensing
         observation.

            Use &quot;LT+S&quot; or &quot;CN+S&quot;: apply both light time and stellar
            aberration corrections.

         Note that using light time corrections alone (&quot;LT&quot;) is
         generally not a good way to obtain an approximation to an
         apparent target vector: since light time and stellar
         aberration corrections often partially cancel each other,
         it may be more accurate to use no correction at all than to
         use light time alone.


      2) Find the corrected pointing direction to radiate a signal
         to a target. This computation is often applicable for
         implementing communications sessions.

            Use &quot;XLT+S&quot; or &quot;XCN+S&quot;: apply both light time and stellar
            aberration corrections for transmission.


      3) Compute the apparent position of a target body relative
         to a star or other distant object.

            Use one of &quot;LT&quot;, &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;LT+S&quot;, or &quot;CN+S&quot; as needed to match
            the correction applied to the position of the distant
            object. For example, if a star position is obtained from a
            catalog, the position vector may not be corrected for
            stellar aberration. In this case, to find the angular
            separation of the star and the limb of a planet, the vector
            from the observer to the planet should be corrected for
            light time but not stellar aberration.


      4) Obtain an uncorrected state vector derived directly from
         data in an SPK file.

            Use &quot;NONE&quot;.


      5) Use a geometric state vector as a low-accuracy estimate
         of the apparent state for an application where execution
         speed is critical.

            Use &quot;NONE&quot;.


      6) While this routine cannot perform the relativistic
         aberration corrections required to compute states
         with the highest possible accuracy, it can supply the
         geometric states required as inputs to these computations.

            Use &quot;NONE&quot;, then apply relativistic aberration
            corrections (not available in the SPICE Toolkit).


   Below, we discuss in more detail how the aberration corrections
   applied by this routine are computed.


   Geometric case
   ==============

      <b>spkapp_c</b> begins by computing the geometric position T(et) of the
      target body relative to the solar system barycenter (SSB).
      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(et) gives
      the geometric position of the target body relative to the
      observer. The one-way light time, 'lt', is given by

                | T(et) - O(et) |
         lt = -------------------
                        c

      The geometric relationship between the observer, target, and
      solar system barycenter is as shown:


         SSB ---&gt; O(et)
          |      /
          |     /
          |    /
          |   /  T(et) - O(et)
          V  V
         T(et)


      The returned state consists of the position vector

         T(et) - O(et)

      and a velocity obtained by taking the difference of the
      corresponding velocities.  In the geometric case, the
      returned velocity is actually the time derivative of the
      position.


   Reception case
   ==============

      When any of the options &quot;LT&quot;, &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;LT+S&quot;, &quot;CN+S&quot; is
      selected, <b>spkapp_c</b> computes the position of the target body at
      epoch et-lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time. Let T(t) and
      O(t) represent the positions of the target and observer
      relative to the solar system barycenter at time t; then `lt' is
      the solution of the light-time equation

                | T(et-lt) - O(et) |
         lt = ------------------------                            (1)
                         c

      The ratio

          | T(et) - O(et) |
        ---------------------                                     (2)
                  c

      is used as a first approximation to `lt'; inserting (2) into the
      RHS of the light-time equation (1) yields the &quot;one-iteration&quot;
      estimate of the one-way light time. Repeating the process
      until the estimates of `lt' converge yields the &quot;converged
      Newtonian&quot; light time estimate.

      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(et) gives
      the position of the target body relative to the observer:
      T(et-lt) - O(et).

         SSB ---&gt; O(et)
          | \     |
          |  \    |
          |   \   | T(et-lt) - O(et)
          |    \  |
          V     V V
         T(et)  T(et-lt)

      The position component of the light-time corrected state
      is the vector

         T(et-lt) - O(et)

      The velocity component of the light-time corrected state
      is the difference

         T_vel(et-lt) - O_vel(et)

      where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of
      the target and observer relative to the solar system
      barycenter at the epochs et-lt and `et'.

      If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
      position is rotated toward the solar system barycenter-
      relative velocity vector of the observer. The rotation is
      computed as follows:

         Let r be the light time corrected vector from the observer
         to the object, and v be the velocity of the observer with
         respect to the solar system barycenter. Let w be the angle
         between them. The aberration angle phi is given by

            sin(phi) = v sin(w) / c

         Let h be the vector given by the cross product

            h = r X v

         Rotate r by phi radians about h to obtain the apparent
         position of the object.

      The velocity component of the output state `starg' is
      not corrected for stellar aberration.


   Transmission case
   ==================

      When any of the options &quot;XLT&quot;, &quot;XCN&quot;, &quot;XLT+S&quot;, &quot;XCN+S&quot; are
      selected, <b>spkapp_c</b> computes the position of the target body T at
      epoch et+lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time. `lt' is the
      solution of the light-time equation

                | T(et+lt) - O(et) |
         lt = ------------------------                            (3)
                          c

      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer, O(et),
      gives the position of the target body relative to the
      observer: T(et-lt) - O(et).

                 SSB --&gt; O(et)
                / |    *
               /  |  *  T(et+lt) - O(et)
              /   |*
             /   *|
            V  V  V
        T(et+lt)  T(et)

      The position component of the light-time corrected state
      is the vector

         T(et+lt) - O(et)

      The velocity component of the light-time corrected state
      is the difference

         T_vel(et+lt) - O_vel(et)

      where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of
      the target and observer relative to the solar system
      barycenter at the epochs et+lt and `et'.

      If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
      position is rotated away from the solar system barycenter-
      relative velocity vector of the observer. The rotation is
      computed as in the reception case, but the sign of the
      rotation angle is negated.

      The velocity component of the output state `starg' is
      not corrected for stellar aberration.

   Neither special nor general relativistic effects are accounted
   for in the aberration corrections performed by this routine.

   In the following code fragment, <a href="spkssb_c.html">spkssb_c</a> and <b>spkapp_c</b> are used
   to display the position of Io (body 501) as seen from the
   Voyager 2 spacecraft (Body -32) at a series of epochs.

   Normally, one would call the high-level reader <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> to obtain
   state vectors. The example below illustrates the interface
   of this routine but is not intended as a recommendation on
   how to use the SPICE SPK subsystem.

   The use of integer ID codes is necessitated by the low-level
   interface of this routine.

      }
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>
<PRE>
   1)  The kernel files to be used by <b>spkapp_c</b> must be loaded
       (normally by the CSPICE kernel loader <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>) before
       this routine is called.

   2)  Unlike most other SPK state computation routines, this
       routine requires that the input state be relative to an
       inertial reference frame. Non-inertial frames are not
       supported by this routine.

   3)  In a future version of this routine, the implementation
       of the aberration corrections may be enhanced to improve
       accuracy.
