   trgpos      is the fixed (constant) position of a target relative to
               its &quot;center of motion&quot; `trgctr', expressed in the
               reference frame `trgref'.

               Units are always km.


   trgctr      is the name of the center of motion of `trgpos'. The
               ephemeris of `trgctr' is provided by loaded SPK files.

               Optionally, you may supply the integer ID code for
               the object as an integer string. For example both
               &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings that indicate
               the moon is the center of motion.

               Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `trgctr'.


   trgref      is the name of the reference frame relative to which
               the input position `trgpos' is expressed. The target has
               constant position relative to its center of motion
               in this reference frame.

               Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `trgref'.


   et          is the ephemeris time at which the state of the
               target relative to the observer is to be
               computed. `et' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.
               `et' refers to time at the observer's location.

               `et' is independent of the target epoch `trgepc'.

   outref      is the name of the reference frame with respect to
               which the output state is expressed.

               When `outref' is time-dependent (non-inertial), its
               orientation relative to the J2000 frame is evaluated
               in the manner commanded by the input argument `refloc'
               (see description below).

               Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `outref'.


   refloc      is a string indicating the output reference frame
               evaluation locus: this is the location associated
               with the epoch at which this routine is to evaluate
               the orientation, relative to the J2000 frame, of the
               output frame `outref'. The values and meanings of
               `refloc' are:

                  &quot;OBSERVER&quot;  Evaluate `outref' at the observer's
                              epoch `et'.

                              Normally the locus &quot;OBSERVER&quot; should
                              be selected when `outref' is centered
                              at the observer.


                  &quot;TARGET&quot;    Evaluate `outref' at the target epoch;
                              letting `lt' be the one-way light time
                              between the target and observer, the
                              target epoch is

                                 et-lt  if reception aberration
                                        corrections are used

                                 et+lt  if transmission aberration
                                        corrections are used

                                 et     if no aberration corrections
                                        are used

                              Normally the locus &quot;TARGET&quot; should
                              be selected when `outref' is `trgref',
                              the frame in which the target position
                              is specified.


                  &quot;CENTER&quot;    Evaluate the frame `outref' at the epoch
                              associated its center. This epoch,
                              which we'll call `etctr', is determined
                              as follows:

                                 Let `ltctr' be the one-way light time
                                 between the observer and the center
                                 of `outref'. Then `etctr' is

                                    et-ltctr  if reception
                                              aberration corrections
                                              are used

                                    et+ltctr  if transmission
                                              aberration corrections
                                              are used

                                    et        if no aberration
                                              corrections are used


                              The locus &quot;CENTER&quot; should be selected
                              when the user intends to obtain
                              results compatible with those produced
                              by <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>.

               When `outref' is inertial, all choices of `refloc'
               yield the same results.

               Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `refloc'.


   abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
               the observer-target state to account for one-way
               light time and stellar aberration.

               `abcorr' may be any of the following:

                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction. Return the
                             geometric state of the target
                             relative to the observer.

               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at `et':

                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the state of the target at the
                             moment it emitted photons arriving at
                             the observer at `et'.

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation. The solution invoked by the
                             &quot;LT&quot; option uses one iteration.

                  &quot;LT+S&quot;     Correct for one-way light time and
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This option modifies the
                             state obtained with the &quot;LT&quot; option to
                             account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The result is the apparent
                             state of the target---the position and
                             velocity of the target as seen by the
                             observer.

                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates
                             until the solution converges.

                  &quot;CN+S&quot;     Converged Newtonian light time
                             and stellar aberration corrections.


               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et+lt:

                  &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This correction yields the
                             state of the target at the moment it
                             receives photons emitted from the
                             observer's location at `et'.

                  &quot;XLT+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation  This option modifies the
                             state obtained with the &quot;XLT&quot; option to
                             account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The position component of
                             the computed target state indicates the
                             direction that photons emitted from the
                             observer's location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to
                             hit the target.

                  &quot;XCN&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  &quot;XCN+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.


               Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
               accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
               by this routine.

               Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `abcorr'.


   obsrvr      is the name of an observing body. Optionally, you
               may supply the ID code of the object as an integer
               string. For example, both &quot;EARTH&quot; and &quot;399&quot; are
               legitimate strings to supply to indicate the
               observer is Earth.

   state       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position
               and velocity of the target relative to the specified
               observer. `state' is corrected for the specified
               aberrations and is expressed with respect to the
               reference frame specified by `outref'. The first three
               components of `state' represent the x-, y- and
               z-components of the target's position; the last three
               components form the corresponding velocity vector.

               The position component of `state' points from the
               observer's location at `et' to the aberration-corrected
               location of the target. Note that the sense of the
               position vector is independent of the direction of
               radiation travel implied by the aberration
               correction.

               The velocity component of `state' is the derivative
               with respect to time of the position component of
               `state'.

               Units are always km and km/sec.

               When `state' is expressed in a time-dependent
               (non-inertial) output frame, the orientation of that
               frame relative to the J2000 frame is evaluated in the
               manner indicated by the input argument `refloc' (see
               description above).


   lt          is the one-way light time between the observer and
               target in seconds. If the target state is corrected
               for aberrations, then `lt' is the one-way light time
               between the observer and the light time corrected
               target location.

   Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
   this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: ephemeris data for target center and observer
      must be loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the
      states of target center and observer relative to the solar
      system barycenter must be calculable from the available
      ephemeris data. Typically ephemeris data are made available
      by loading one or more SPK files using <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   The following data may be required:

   -  PCK data: if the target frame is a PCK frame, rotation data
      for the target frame must be loaded. These may be provided
      in a text or binary PCK file.

   -  Frame data: if a frame definition not built into SPICE is
      required, for example to convert the observer-target state
      to the output frame, that definition must be available in
      the kernel pool. Typically frame definitions are supplied
      by loading a frame kernel using <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   -  Additional kernels: if any frame used in this routine's
      state computation is a CK frame, then at least one CK and
      corresponding SCLK kernel is required. If dynamic frames
      are used, additional SPK, PCK, CK, or SCLK kernels may be
      required.

   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

   This routine computes observer-target states for targets whose
   trajectories are not provided by SPK files.

   Targets supported by this routine must have constant position
   with respect to a specified center of motion, expressed in a
   caller-specified reference frame. The state of the center of
   motion relative to the observer must be computable using
   loaded SPK data.

   For applications in which the target has non-zero, constant
   velocity relative to its center of motion, the CSPICE routine

      <a href="spkcvt_c.html">spkcvt_c</a>     { SPK, constant velocity target }

   can be used.

   This routine is suitable for computing states of landmarks on the
   surface of an extended object, as seen by a specified observer,
   in cases where no SPK data are available for those landmarks.

   This routine's treatment of the output reference frame differs
   from that of the principal SPK API routines

      <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>
      <a href="spkez_c.html">spkez_c</a>
      <a href="spkpos_c.html">spkpos_c</a>
      <a href="spkezp_c.html">spkezp_c</a>

   which require both observer and target ephemerides to be provided
   by loaded SPK files:

      The SPK API routines listed above evaluate the orientation of
      the output reference frame (with respect to the J2000 frame)
      at an epoch corrected for one-way light time between the
      observer and the center of the output frame. When the center
      of the output frame is not the target (for example, when the
      target is on the surface of Mars and the output frame is
      centered at Mars' center), the epoch of evaluation may not
      closely match the light-time corrected epoch associated with
      the target itself.

      This routine allows the caller to dictate how the orientation
      of the output reference frame is to be evaluated. The caller
      passes to this routine an input string called the output
      frame's evaluation &quot;locus.&quot; This string specifies the location
      associated with the output frame's evaluation epoch. The three
      possible values of the locus are

         &quot;TARGET&quot;
         &quot;OBSERVER&quot;
         &quot;CENTER&quot;

      The choice of locus has an effect when aberration corrections
      are used and the output frame is non-inertial.

      When the locus is &quot;TARGET&quot; and light time corrections are used,
      the orientation of the output frame is evaluated at the epoch
      obtained by correcting the observation epoch `et' for one-way
      observer-target light time `lt'. The evaluation epoch will be
      either et-lt or et+lt for reception or transmission corrections
      respectively.

      For remote sensing applications where the target is a surface
      point on an extended object, and the orientation of that
      object should be evaluated at the emission time, the locus
      &quot;TARGET&quot; should be used.

      When the output frame's orientation should be evaluated at
      the observation epoch `et', which is the case when the
      output frame is centered at the observer, the locus
      &quot;OBSERVER&quot; should be used.

      The locus option &quot;CENTER&quot; is provided for compatibility
      with existing SPK state computation APIs such as <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>.

      Note that the output frame evaluation locus does not affect
      the computation of light time between the target and
      observer.


   The SPK routines that compute observer-target states for
   combinations of objects having ephemerides provided by SPK files and
   objects having constant position or constant velocity are

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
   specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) Demonstrate use of this routine; in particular demonstrate
      applications of the output frame evaluation locus.

      The following program is not necessarily realistic: for
      brevity, it combines several unrelated computations.

      Task Description
      ================

      Find the state of a given surface point on earth, corrected
      for light time and stellar aberration, relative to the Mars
      Global Surveyor spacecraft, expressed in the earth fixed
      reference frame ITRF93. The selected point is the position
      of the DSN station DSS-14.

      Contrast the states computed by setting the output frame
      evaluation locus to &quot;TARGET&quot; and to &quot;CENTER&quot;. Show that the
      latter choice produces results very close to those that
      can be obtained using <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>.

      Also compute the state of a selected Mars surface point as
      seen from MGS. The point we'll use is the narrow angle MOC
      boresight surface intercept corresponding to the chosen
      observation time. Express the state in a spacecraft-centered
      reference frame. Use the output frame evaluation locus
      &quot;OBSERVER&quot; for this computation.

      The observation epoch is 2003 OCT 13 06:00:00 UTC.
