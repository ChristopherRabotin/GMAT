   occtyp      indicates the type of occultation that is to be found.
               Supported values and corresponding definitions are:

                  &quot;FULL&quot;      denotes the full occultation of the body
                              designated by `back' by the body designated
                              by `front', as seen from the location of the
                              observer. In other words, the occulted
                              body is completely invisible as seen from
                              the observer's location.

                  &quot;ANNULAR&quot;   denotes an annular occultation: the body
                              designated by `front' blocks part of, but
                              not the limb of, the body designated by
                              `back', as seen from the location of the
                              observer.

                  &quot;PARTIAL&quot;   denotes a partial, non-annular
                              occultation: the body designated by `front'
                              blocks part, but not all, of the limb of
                              the body designated by `back', as seen from
                              the location of the observer.

                  &quot;ANY&quot;       denotes any of the above three types of
                              occultations: &quot;PARTIAL&quot;, &quot;ANNULAR&quot;, or
                              &quot;FULL&quot;.

                              &quot;ANY&quot; should be used to search for times
                              when the body designated by `front' blocks
                              any part of the body designated by `back'.

                              The option &quot;ANY&quot; must be used if either
                              the front or back target body is modeled
                              as a point.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant
               in the string `occtyp'.

   front       is the name of the target body that occults --- that is,
               passes in front of --- the other. Optionally, you may
               supply the integer NAIF ID code for the body as a string.
               For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings
               that designate the Moon.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant
               in the string `front'.

   fshape      is a string indicating the geometric model used to
               represent the shape of the front target body. The
               supported options are:

                  &quot;ELLIPSOID&quot;

                      Use a triaxial ellipsoid model with radius values
                      provided via the kernel pool. A kernel variable
                      having a name of the form

                         BODYnnn_RADII

                      where nnn represents the NAIF integer code
                      associated with the body, must be present in the
                      kernel pool. This variable must be associated with
                      three numeric values giving the lengths of the
                      ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.

                  &quot;POINT&quot;

                      Treat the body as a single point. When a point
                      target is specified, the occultation type must be
                      set to &quot;ANY&quot;.

                  &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]&quot;

                      Use topographic data provided by DSK files to
                      model the body's shape. These data must be
                      provided by loaded DSK files.

                      The surface list specification is optional. The
                      syntax of the list is

                         &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...]

                      If present, it indicates that data only for the
                      listed surfaces are to be used; however, data need
                      not be available for all surfaces in the list. If
                      absent, loaded DSK data for any surface associated
                      with the target body are used.

                      The surface list may contain surface names or
                      surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must be
                      delimited by double quotes, for example

                         SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;

                      If multiple surfaces are specified, their names or
                      IDs must be separated by commas.

                      See the -Particulars section below for details
                      concerning use of DSK data.

               The combinations of the shapes of the target bodies
               `front' and `back' must be one of:

                  One ELLIPSOID, one POINT
                  Two ELLIPSOIDs
                  One DSK, one POINT

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `fshape'.

   fframe      is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
               frame associated with the front target body. Examples
               of such names are &quot;IAU_SATURN&quot; (for Saturn) and
               &quot;ITRF93&quot; (for the Earth).

               If the front target body is modeled as a point, `fframe'
               should be left empty or blank.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
               non-blank frame name are not significant in the string
               `fframe'.

   back        is the name of the target body that is occulted by ---
               that is, passes in back of --- the other. Optionally, you
               may supply the integer NAIF ID code for the body as a
               string. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate
               strings that designate the Moon.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `back'.

   bshape      is the shape specification for the body designated by
               `back'. The supported options are those for `fshape'. See the
               description of `fshape' above for details.

   bframe      is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
               frame associated with the &quot;back&quot; target body. See the
               description of `fframe' above for details. Examples of such
               names are &quot;IAU_SATURN&quot; (for Saturn) and &quot;ITRF93&quot; (for the
               Earth).

               If the back target body is modeled as a point, `bframe'
               should be left empty or blank.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
               non-blank frame name are not significant in the string
               `bframe'.

   abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to the
               state of the target body to account for one-way light
               time. Stellar aberration corrections are ignored if
               specified, since these corrections don't improve the
               accuracy of the occultation determination.

               See the header of the SPICE routine <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> for a detailed
               description of the aberration correction options. For
               convenience, the options supported by this routine are
               listed below:

                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction.

                  &quot;LT&quot;       &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  &quot;CN&quot;       &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  &quot;XCN&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

               Case and blanks are not significant in the string
               `abcorr'.

   obsrvr      is the name of the body from which the occultation is
               observed. Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF
               ID code for the body as a string.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `obsrvr'.

   tol         is a tolerance value used to determine convergence of
               root-finding operations. `tol' is measured in TDB seconds
               and must be greater than zero.

   udstep      is an externally specified routine that computes a
               time step used to find transitions of the state being
               considered. A state transition occurs where the state
               changes from being &quot;in occultation&quot; to being &quot;not in
               occultation&quot; or vice versa.

               This routine relies on `udstep' returning step sizes small
               enough so that state transitions within the confinement
               window are not overlooked. There must never be two roots
               A and B separated by less than `step', where `step' is the
               minimum step size returned by `udstep' for any value of `et';
               in the interval [A, B].

               The prototype for `udstep' is

                  void   ( * udstep ) ( SpiceDouble       et,
                                        SpiceDouble     * step )

               where:

                  et      is the input start time from which the
                          algorithm is to search forward for a state
                          transition. `et' is expressed as seconds past
                          J2000 TDB.

                  step    is the output step size. `step' indicates
                          how far to advance `et' so that `et' and
                          et+step may bracket a state transition and
                          definitely do not bracket more than one
                          state transition. Units are TDB seconds.

               If a constant step size is desired, the CSPICE routine

                  <a href="gfstep_c.html">gfstep_c</a>

               may be used as the step size function. If <a href="gfstep_c.html">gfstep_c</a> is used,
               the step size must be set by calling <a href="gfsstp_c.html">gfsstp_c</a> prior to
               calling this routine.

   udrefn      is the name of the externally specified routine that
               refines the times that bracket a transition point. In
               other words, once a pair of times, `t1' and `t2', that
               bracket a state transition have been found, `udrefn'
               computes an intermediate time `t' such that either [t1, t]
               or [t, t2] contains the time of the state transition. The
               prototype for `udrefn' is:

                  void   ( * udrefn ) ( SpiceDouble       t1,
                                        SpiceDouble       t2,
                                        SpiceBoolean      s1,
                                        SpiceBoolean      s2,
                                        SpiceDouble     * t   )

               where the inputs are:

                  t1    is a time when the visibility state is `s1'. `t1'
                        is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

                  t2    is a time when the visibility state is `s2'. `t2' is
                        expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB. `t2' is
                        assumed to be larger than `t1'.

                  s1    is the visibility state at time `t1'.

                  s2    is the visibility state at time `t2'.

               The output is:

                  t     is the next time to check for a state
                        transition. `t' is expressed as seconds past
                        J2000 TDB and is between `t1' and `t2'.

               If a simple bisection method is desired, the CSPICE
               routine <a href="gfrefn_c.html">gfrefn_c</a> may be used.

   rpt         is a logical variable which controls whether progress
               reporting is enabled. When `rpt' is SPICETRUE, progress
               reporting is enabled and the routines `udrepi', `udrepu', and
               `udrepf' (see descriptions below) are used to report
               progress.

   udrepi      is a user-defined routine that initializes a progress
               report. When progress reporting is enabled, `udrepi' is
               called at the start of a search. The prototype for
               `udrepi' is

                  void   ( * udrepi ) ( SpiceCell       * cnfine,
                                        ConstSpiceChar  * srcpre,
                                        ConstSpiceChar  * srcsuf )

               where

                  cnfine

               is the confinement window specifying the time period over
               which a search is conducted, and

                  srcpre
                  srcsuf

               are prefix and suffix strings used in the progress
               report: these strings are intended to bracket a
               representation of the fraction of work done. For example,
               when the CSPICE progress reporting functions are used, if
               `srcpre' and `srcsuf' are, respectively,

                  &quot;Occultation/transit search&quot;
                  &quot;done.&quot;

               the progress report display at the end of the
               search will be:

                  Occultation/transit search 100.00% done.

               The CSPICE routine <a href="gfrepi_c.html">gfrepi_c</a> may be used as the actual
               argument corresponding to `udrepi'. If so, the CSPICE
               routines <a href="gfrepu_c.html">gfrepu_c</a> and <a href="gfrepf_c.html">gfrepf_c</a> must be the actual arguments
               corresponding to `udrepu' and `udrepf'.

   udrepu      is a user-defined routine that updates the progress
               report for a search. The prototype of `udrepu' is

                  void   ( * udrepu ) ( SpiceDouble       ivbeg,
                                        SpiceDouble       ivend,
                                        SpiceDouble       et      )

               Here `ivbeg', `ivend' are the bounds of an interval that is
               contained in some interval belonging to the confinement
               window. The confinement window is associated with some
               root finding activity. It is used to determine how much
               total time is being searched in order to find the events
               of interest.

               `et' is an epoch belonging to the interval
               [`ivbeg', `ivend'].

               In order for a meaningful progress report to be
               displayed, `ivbeg' and `ivend' must satisfy the following
               constraints:

                - `ivbeg' must be less than or equal to `ivend'.

                - The interval [ `ivbeg', `ivend' ] must be contained in
                  some interval of the confinement window. It can be
                  a proper subset of the containing interval; that
                  is, it can be smaller than the interval of the
                  confinement window that contains it.

                - Over a search, the sum of the differences

                     ivend - ivbeg

                  for all calls to this routine made during the search
                  must equal the measure (that is, the sum of the
                  lengths of the intervals) of the confinement window
                  `cnfine'.

               `et' is the current time reached in the search for an event.
               `et' must lie in the interval

                  ivbeg : ivend

               inclusive. The input values of `et' for a given interval
               need not form an increasing sequence.

               The CSPICE routine <a href="gfrepu_c.html">gfrepu_c</a> may be used as the actual
               argument corresponding to `udrepu'. If so, the CSPICE
               routines <a href="gfrepi_c.html">gfrepi_c</a> and <a href="gfrepf_c.html">gfrepf_c</a> must be the actual arguments
               corresponding to `udrepi' and `udrepf'.

   udrepf      is a user-defined routine that finalizes a
               progress report. `udrepf' has no arguments.

               The CSPICE routine <a href="gfrepf_c.html">gfrepf_c</a> may be used as the actual
               argument corresponding to `udrepf'. If so, the CSPICE
               routines <a href="gfrepi_c.html">gfrepi_c</a> and <a href="gfrepu_c.html">gfrepu_c</a> must be the actual arguments
               corresponding to `udrepi' and `udrepu'.

   bail        is a logical variable indicating whether or not interrupt
               handling is enabled. When `bail' is set to SPICETRUE, the
               input function `udbail' (see description below) is used to
               determine whether an interrupt has been issued.

   udbail      is the name of a user defined logical function that
               indicates whether an interrupt signal has been issued
               (for example, from the keyboard). The prototype of `udbail'
               is

                  SpiceBoolean   ( * udbail ) ( void )

               The return value is SPICETRUE if an interrupt has
               been issued; otherwise the value is SPICEFALSE.

               <b>gfocce_c</b> uses `udbail' only when `bail' (see above) is set to
               SPICETRUE, indicating that interrupt handling is enabled.
               When interrupt handling is enabled, <b>gfocce_c</b> and routines
               in its call tree will call `udbail' to determine whether to
               terminate processing and return immediately.

               If interrupt handing is not enabled, a logical function
               must still be passed to <b>gfocce_c</b> as an input argument. The
               CSPICE function

                  <a href="gfbail_c.html">gfbail_c</a>

               may be used for this purpose.

               The function `udbail' will usually be tested multiple times by
               the GF system between the time an interrupt is issued and the
               time when control is returned to the calling program, so
               `udbail' must continue to return SPICETRUE until explicitly
               reset by the calling application. Therefore `udbail' must
               provide a &quot;reset&quot; mechanism.&quot; In the case of <a href="gfbail_c.html">gfbail_c</a>, the reset
               function is

                  <a href="gfclrh_c.html">gfclrh_c</a>

               See the -Examples header section below for a complete code
               example demonstrating use of the CSPICE interrupt handling
               capability.

   cnfine      is a SPICE window that confines the time period over
               which the specified search is conducted. `cnfine' may
               consist of a single interval or a collection of
               intervals.

               The endpoints of the time intervals comprising `cnfine'
               are interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.

               See the -Examples section below for a code example
               that shows how to create a confinement window.

               `cnfine' must be declared as a double precision SpiceCell.

               CSPICE provides the following macro, which declares and
               initializes the cell

                  SPICEDOUBLE_CELL        ( cnfine, CNFINESZ );

               where CNFINESZ is the maximum capacity of `cnfine'.

   cnfine      is the input confinement window, updated if necessary so the
               control area of its data array indicates the window's size
               and cardinality. The window data are unchanged.

   result      is a SPICE window representing the set of time intervals,
               within the confinement period, when the specified
               occultation occurs.

               `result' must be declared and initialized with sufficient
               size to capture the full set of time intervals within the
               search region on which the specified condition is satisfied.

               If `result' is non-empty on input, its contents will be
               discarded before <b>gfocce_c</b> conducts its search.

               The endpoints of the time intervals comprising `result' are
               interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.

               If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
               search criteria, `result' will be returned with a
               cardinality of zero.

               `result' must be declared as a double precision SpiceCell.

               CSPICE provides the following macro, which declares and
               initializes the cell

                  SPICEDOUBLE_CELL        ( result, RESULTSZ );

   1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
       the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
       Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
       roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
       to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
       roots.

       This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
       that if the step size is non-positive, an error is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

          - Truncation error in time values
          - Finite tolerance value
          - Errors in computed geometric quantities

       it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
       satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
       result window.

       The result window may need to be contracted slightly by the
       caller to achieve desired results. The SPICE window routine
       <a href="wncond_c.html">wncond_c</a> can be used to contract the result window.

   3)  If name of either target or the observer cannot be translated
       to a NAIF ID code, an error is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   4)  If the radii of a target body modeled as an ellipsoid cannot
       be determined by searching the kernel pool for a kernel
       variable having a name of the form

          &quot;BODYnnn_RADII&quot;

       where nnn represents the NAIF integer code associated with
       the body, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   5)  If either of the target bodies `front' or `back' coincides with
       the observer body `obsrvr', an error is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   6)  If the body designated by `front' coincides with that designated
       by `back', an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   7)  If either of the body model specifiers `fshape' or `bshape' is not
       recognized, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   8)  If both of the body model specifiers `fshape' and `bshape'
       specify point targets, the error SPICE(INVALIDSHAPECOMBO)
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   9)  If a target body-fixed reference frame associated with a
       non-point target is not recognized, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   10) If a target body-fixed reference frame is not centered at the
       corresponding target body, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   11) If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute the
       requested state vector, an error is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   12) If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file,
       the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   13) If a point target is specified and the occultation type is set
       to a valid value other than &quot;ANY&quot;, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   14) If the output SPICE window `result' has insufficient capacity to
       contain the number of intervals on which the specified
       occultation condition is met, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   15) If the result window has size less than 2, the error
       SPICE(WINDOWTOOSMALL) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   16) If the occultation type `occtyp' is invalid, an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   17) If the aberration correction specification `abcorr' is invalid,
       an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   18) If the convergence tolerance size is non-positive, the error
       SPICE(INVALIDTOLERANCE) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   19) If either `fshape' or `bshape' specifies that the target surface
       is represented by DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for
       the specified target, an error is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   20) If either `fshape' or `bshape' specifies that the target surface
       is represented by DSK data, but the shape specification is
       invalid, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   21) If operation of this routine is interrupted, the output result
       window will be invalid.

   22) If any of the `occtyp', `front', `fshape', `back', `bshape',
       `abcorr', `obsrvr', `bframe' or `fframe' input string pointers
       is null, the error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled.

   23) If any of the `occtyp', `front', `fshape', `back', `bshape',
       `abcorr' or `obsrvr' input strings has zero length, the error
       SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled.

   24) If any the `cnfine' or `result' cell arguments has a type
       other than SpiceDouble, the error SPICE(TYPEMISMATCH) is
       signaled.

   25) If any attempt to change the handler for the interrupt signal
       SIGINT fails, the error SPICE(SIGNALFAILED) is signaled.

   Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
   before this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: the calling application must load ephemeris data
      for the targets, source and observer that cover the time
      period specified by the window `cnfine'. If aberration
      corrections are used, the states of the target bodies and of
      the observer relative to the solar system barycenter must be
      calculable from the available ephemeris data. Typically
      ephemeris data are made available by loading one or more SPK
      files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   -  PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
      semi-axis lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool.
      Typically these data are made available by loading a text
      PCK file via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   -  FK data: if either of the reference frames designated by
      `bframe' or `fframe' are not built in to the SPICE system,
      one or more FKs specifying these frames must be loaded.

   The following data may be required:

   -  DSK data: if either `fshape' or `bshape' indicates that DSK
      data are to be used, DSK files containing topographic data
      for the target body must be loaded. If a surface list is
      specified, data for at least one of the listed surfaces must
      be loaded.

   -  Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified
      in `fshape' or `bshape', the association of these names with
      their corresponding surface ID codes must be established by
      assignments of the kernel variables

         NAIF_SURFACE_NAME
         NAIF_SURFACE_CODE
         NAIF_SURFACE_BODY

      Normally these associations are made by loading a text
      kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example
      of such a set of assignments is

         NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'
         NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1
         NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499

   -  CK data: either of the body-fixed frames to which `fframe' or
      `bframe' refer might be a CK frame. If so, at least one CK
      file will be needed to permit transformation of vectors
      between that frame and the J2000 frame.

   -  SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
      kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
      (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
      (TDB).

   Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every
   time this routine is called.

   This routine provides the SPICE GF system's most flexible
   interface for searching for occultation events.

   Applications that require do not require support for progress
   reporting, interrupt handling, non-default step or refinement
   functions, or non-default convergence tolerance normally should
   call <a href="gfoclt_c.html">gfoclt_c</a> rather than this routine.

   This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
   within the confinement window when a specified type of
   occultation occurs. The resulting set of intervals is returned as
   a SPICE window.

   Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
   solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
   use of this routine in user applications.


   The Search Process
   ==================

   The search for occultations is treated as a search for state
   transitions: times are sought when the state of the BACK body
   changes from &quot;not occulted&quot; to &quot;occulted&quot; or vice versa.

   Step Size
   =========

   Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows:
   first, the input step size is used to determine the time
   separation at which the occultation state will be sampled.
   Starting at the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be
   taken at each step. If a state change is detected, a root has
   been bracketed; at that point, the &quot;root&quot;--the time at which the
   state change occurs---is found by a refinement process, for
   example, via binary search.

   Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
   of the intervals over which the occultation state is constant:
   the step size should be shorter than the shortest occultation
   duration and the shortest period between occultations, within
   the confinement window.

   Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the targets and
   observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
   In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
   picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
   time.

   Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
   the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
   That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


   Convergence Tolerance
   =====================

   Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
   narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie. This
   refinement process terminates when the location of the root has been
   determined to within an error margin called the &quot;convergence
   tolerance.&quot; The convergence tolerance used by high-level GF routines
   that call this routine is set via the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL,
   which is declared in the header file SpiceGF.h.

   The value of SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
   tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
   solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
   data will be the limiting factor.

   Making the tolerance tighter than SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is unlikely to be
   useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate. Making
   the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat, since a few
   convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most cases, the step
   size is likely to have a much greater affect on processing time than
   would the convergence tolerance.


   The Confinement Window
   ======================

   The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
   interval within which a solution is sought. However, the confinement
   window can, in some cases, be used to make searches more efficient.
   Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search to reduce the size
   of the time period over which a relatively slow search of interest
   must be performed. For an example, see the program CASCADE in the GF
   Example Programs chapter of the GF Required Reading, gf.req.


   Using DSK data
   ==============

      DSK loading and unloading
      -------------------------

      DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by
      calling <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="unload_c.html">unload_c</a> or
      <a href="kclear_c.html">kclear_c</a>. See the documentation of <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> for limits on numbers
      of loaded DSK files.

      For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent
      loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to
      use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for
      example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be
      used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be
      used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload
      the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes
      that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a
      given body have different surface ID codes.


      DSK data priority
      -----------------

      A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK
      files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a
      given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time
      intervals of the segments overlap as well.

      When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage
      overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK
      files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes
      precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the
      segment located closer to the end of the file takes
      precedence.

      When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing
      segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments
      both represent a surface as a set of triangular plates, the
      union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the
      surface.

      Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported.
      Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior
      in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is
      required in the `fshape' and `bshape' arguments.


      Syntax of the shape input arguments for the DSK case
      ----------------------------------------------------

      The keywords and surface list in the target shape arguments
      `bshape' and `fshape' are called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may
      appear in any order, for example

         &quot;DSK/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED&quot;
         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;&quot;
         &quot;UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK&quot;

      The simplest form of the `method' argument specifying use of
      DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example:

         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED&quot;

      For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target
      body are for a single surface, and there are no competing
      segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be
      the usual case.

      When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK
      files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the
      surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be
      specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the
      surfaces are to be used together.

      The surface list consists of the string

         &quot;SURFACES = &quot;

      followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface
      identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in
      string format. For example, suppose we have the surface
      names and corresponding ID codes shown below:

         Surface Name                              ID code
         ------------                              -------
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                1
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                 2
         &quot;Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;                         3

      If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then
      data for surface 1 can be specified by either

         &quot;SURFACES = 1&quot;

      or

         &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;&quot;

      Escaped double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because
      it contains blank characters.

      To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any
      of the following surface lists could be used:

         &quot;SURFACES = 2, 3&quot;

         &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, 3&quot;

         &quot;SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;

         &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;

      An example of a shape argument that could be constructed
      using one of the surface lists above is

         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, 3&quot;

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
   specific arithmetic implementation.


   1) Conduct a search using default GF progress reporting
      and interrupt handling capabilities.

      The program will use console I/O to display a simple
      ASCII-based progress report.

      The program will trap keyboard interrupts (on most systems,
      generated by typing the &quot;control C&quot; key combination). This
      feature can be used in non-trivial applications to allow
      the application to continue after a search as been interrupted.

      The program will find occultations of the Sun by the Moon as seen
      from the center of the Earth over the month December, 2001.

      Use light time corrections to model apparent positions of Sun
      and Moon. Stellar aberration corrections are not specified
      because they don't affect occultation computations.

      We select a step size of 20 seconds, which implies we ignore
      occultation events lasting less than 20 seconds, if any exist.
      Given this step size and the length of the search interval, the
      user has time to interrupt the computation. In an interactive
      setting, the user might speed up the search by lengthening the
      step size or shortening the search interval, as long as these
      adjustments don't prevent the search from finding the correct
      solution.

      Use the meta-kernel shown below to load the required SPICE
      kernels.
