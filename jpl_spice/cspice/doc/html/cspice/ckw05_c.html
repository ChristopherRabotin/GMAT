   handle      is the handle of the CK file to which the segment will be
               written. The file must have been opened with write
               access.

   subtyp      is an integer code indicating the subtype of the
               segment to be created.

   degree      is the degree of the polynomials used to interpolate the
               quaternions contained in the input packets. All
               components of the quaternions are interpolated by
               polynomials of fixed degree.

   begtim,
   endtim      are the beginning and ending encoded SCLK times
               for which the segment provides pointing information.
               begtim must be less than or equal to endtim, and at least
               one data packet must have a time tag t such that

                         begtim  &lt;  t  &lt;  endtim
                                 -     -

   inst        is the NAIF integer ID code for the instrument.

   ref         is a character string which specifies the
               reference frame of the segment. This should be one of
               the frames supported by the SPICELIB routine NAMFRM
               which is an entry point of FRAMEX.

               The rotation matrices represented by the quaternions
               that are to be written to the segment transform the
               components of vectors from the inertial reference frame
               specified by ref to components in the instrument fixed
               frame. Also, the components of the angular velocity
               vectors to be written to the segment should be given
               with respect to ref.

               ref should be the name of one of the frames supported
               by the SPICELIB routine NAMFRM.


   avflag      is a boolean flag which indicates whether or not the
               segment will contain angular velocity.

   segid       is the segment identifier.  A CK segment identifier may
               contain up to 40 characters, excluding the terminating
               null.

   packts      contains a time-ordered array of data packets
               representing the orientation of inst relative to the
               frame ref. Each packet contains a SPICE-style quaternion
               and optionally, depending on the segment subtype,
               attitude derivative data, from which a C-matrix and an
               angular velocity vector may be derived.

               See the discussion of &quot;Quaternion Styles&quot; in the
               -Particulars section below.

               The C-matrix represented by the Ith data packet is a
               rotation matrix that transforms the components of a
               vector expressed in the base frame specified by ref to
               components expressed in the instrument fixed frame at the
               time sclkdp(I).

               Thus, if a vector v has components x, y, z in the base
               frame, then v has components x', y', z' in the instrument
               fixed frame where:

                  [ x' ]     [          ] [ x ]
                  | y' |  =  |   cmat   | | y |
                  [ z' ]     [          ] [ z ]


               The attitude derivative information in packts[i] gives
               the angular velocity of the instrument fixed frame at
               time sclkdp[i] with respect to the reference frame
               specified by ref.

               The direction of an angular velocity vector gives the
               right-handed axis about which the instrument fixed
               reference frame is rotating. The magnitude of the vector
               is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity of the
               rotation, in radians per second.

               Packet contents and the corresponding interpolation
               methods depend on the segment subtype, and are as
               follows:

                  Subtype 0:  Hermite interpolation, 8-element packets.
                              Quaternion and quaternion derivatives
                              only, no angular velocity vector provided.
                              Quaternion elements are listed first,
                              followed by derivatives. Angular velocity
                              is derived from the quaternions and
                              quaternion derivatives.

                  Subtype 1:  Lagrange interpolation, 4-element packets.
                              Quaternion only. Angular velocity is
                              derived by differentiating the
                              interpolating polynomials.

                  Subtype 2:  Hermite interpolation, 14-element packets.
                              Quaternion and angular angular velocity
                              vector, as well as derivatives of each,
                              are provided. The quaternion comes first,
                              then quaternion derivatives, then angular
                              velocity and its derivatives.

                  Subtype 3:  Lagrange interpolation, 7-element packets.
                              Quaternion and angular velocity vector
                              provided. The quaternion comes first.

               Angular velocity is always specified relative to the base
               frame.

   rate        is the nominal rate of the spacecraft clock associated
               with inst. Units are seconds per tick. rate is used to
               scale angular velocity to radians/second.

   nints       is the number of intervals that the pointing instances
               are partitioned into.

   starts      are the start times of each of the interpolation
               intervals. These times must be strictly increasing and
               must coincide with times for which the segment contains
               pointing.

   MAXDEG     is the maximum allowed degree of the interpolating

<h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4>
<PRE>
   If any of the following exceptions occur, this routine will
   return without creating a new segment.

   1)  If `handle' is not the handle of a C-kernel opened for writing,
       an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   2)  If the last non-blank character of `segid' occurs past index 40,
       the error SPICE(SEGIDTOOLONG) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   3)  If `segid' contains any nonprintable characters, the error
       SPICE(NONPRINTABLECHARS) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   4)  If the first encoded SCLK time is negative, the error
       SPICE(INVALIDSCLKTIME) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine. If any subsequent times are negative the
       error will be detected in exception (5).

   5)  If the encoded SCLK times are not strictly increasing, the
       error SPICE(TIMESOUTOFORDER) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   6)  If the name of the reference frame is not one of those
       supported by the routine FRAMEX, the error
       SPICE(INVALIDREFFRAME) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   7)  If the number of packets `n' is not at least 1, the error
       SPICE(TOOFEWPACKETS) is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   8)  If `nints', the number of interpolation intervals, is less than
       or equal to 0, the error SPICE(INVALIDNUMINTS) is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   9)  If the encoded SCLK interval start times are not strictly
       increasing, the error SPICE(TIMESOUTOFORDER) is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   10) If an interval start time does not coincide with a time for
       which there is an actual pointing instance in the segment, the
       error SPICE(INVALIDSTARTTIME) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   11) This routine assumes that the rotation between adjacent
       quaternions that are stored in the same interval has a
       rotation angle of `theta' radians, where

          0  &lt;=  theta  &lt;  pi.

       The routines that evaluate the data in the segment produced
       by this routine cannot distinguish between rotations of `theta'
       radians, where `theta' is in the interval [0, pi), and
       rotations of

          theta   +   2 * k * pi

       radians, where k is any integer. These &quot;large&quot; rotations will
       yield invalid results when interpolated. You must ensure that
       the data stored in the segment will not be subject to this
       sort of ambiguity.

   12) If any quaternion has magnitude zero, the error
       SPICE(ZEROQUATERNION) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   13) If the interpolation window size implied by `degree' is not
       even, the error SPICE(INVALIDDEGREE) is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine. The window size is degree+1
       for Lagrange subtypes and is (degree+1)/2 for Hermite
       subtypes.

   14) If an unrecognized subtype code is supplied, the error
       SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   15) If `degree' is not at least 1 or is greater than MAXDEG, the
       error SPICE(INVALIDDEGREE) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   16) If the segment descriptor bounds are out of order, the error
       SPICE(BADDESCRTIMES) is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   17) If there is no element of `sclkdp' that lies between `begtim' and
       `endtim' inclusive, the error SPICE(EMPTYSEGMENT) is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   18) If `rate' is zero, the error SPICE(INVALIDVALUE) is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   19) If any of the `ref' or `segid' input string pointers is null,
       the error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled.

   20) If any of the `ref' or `segid' input strings has zero length,
       the error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled.

   Quaternion Styles
   -----------------

   There are different &quot;styles&quot; of quaternions used in
   science and engineering applications. Quaternion styles
   are characterized by

   -  The order of quaternion elements

   -  The quaternion multiplication formula

   -  The convention for associating quaternions
      with rotation matrices

   Two of the commonly used styles are

      - &quot;SPICE&quot;

         &gt; Invented by Sir William Rowan Hamilton
         &gt; Frequently used in mathematics and physics textbooks

      - &quot;Engineering&quot;

         &gt; Widely used in aerospace engineering applications


   CSPICE function interfaces ALWAYS use SPICE quaternions.
   Quaternions of any other style must be converted to SPICE
   quaternions before they are passed to CSPICE functions.


   Relationship between SPICE and Engineering Quaternions
   ------------------------------------------------------

   Let M be a rotation matrix such that for any vector V,

      M*V

   is the result of rotating V by theta radians in the
   counterclockwise direction about unit rotation axis vector A.
   Then the SPICE quaternions representing M are

      (+/-) (  cos(theta/2),
               sin(theta/2) A(1),
               sin(theta/2) A(2),
               sin(theta/2) A(3)  )

   while the engineering quaternions representing M are

      (+/-) ( -sin(theta/2) A(1),
              -sin(theta/2) A(2),
              -sin(theta/2) A(3),
               cos(theta/2)       )

   For both styles of quaternions, if a quaternion q represents
   a rotation matrix M, then -q represents M as well.

   Given an engineering quaternion

      QENG   = ( q0,  q1,  q2,  q3 )

   the equivalent SPICE quaternion is

      QSPICE = ( q3, -q0, -q1, -q2 )


   Associating SPICE Quaternions with Rotation Matrices
   ----------------------------------------------------

   Let FROM and TO be two right-handed reference frames, for
   example, an inertial frame and a spacecraft-fixed frame. Let the
   symbols

      V    ,   V
       FROM     TO

   denote, respectively, an arbitrary vector expressed relative to
   the FROM and TO frames. Let M denote the transformation matrix
   that transforms vectors from frame FROM to frame TO; then

      V   =  M * V
       TO         FROM

   where the expression on the right hand side represents left
   multiplication of the vector by the matrix.

   Then if the unit-length SPICE quaternion q represents M, where

      q = (q0, q1, q2, q3)

   the elements of M are derived from the elements of q as follows:

        +-                                                         -+
        |           2    2                                          |
        | 1 - 2*( q2 + q3 )   2*(q1*q2 - q0*q3)   2*(q1*q3 + q0*q2) |
        |                                                           |
        |                                                           |
        |                               2    2                      |
    M = | 2*(q1*q2 + q0*q3)   1 - 2*( q1 + q3 )   2*(q2*q3 - q0*q1) |
        |                                                           |
        |                                                           |
        |                                                   2    2  |
        | 2*(q1*q3 - q0*q2)   2*(q2*q3 + q0*q1)   1 - 2*( q1 + q2 ) |
        |                                                           |
        +-                                                         -+

   Note that substituting the elements of -q for those of q in the
   right hand side leaves each element of M unchanged; this shows
   that if a quaternion q represents a matrix M, then so does the
   quaternion -q.

   To map the rotation matrix M to a unit quaternion, we start by
   decomposing the rotation matrix as a sum of symmetric
   and skew-symmetric parts:

                                      2
      M = [ I  +  (1-cos(theta)) OMEGA  ] + [ sin(theta) OMEGA ]

                   symmetric                   skew-symmetric


   OMEGA is a skew-symmetric matrix of the form

                 +-             -+
                 |  0   -n3   n2 |
                 |               |
       OMEGA  =  |  n3   0   -n1 |
                 |               |
                 | -n2   n1   0  |
                 +-             -+

   The vector N of matrix entries (n1, n2, n3) is the rotation axis
   of M and theta is M's rotation angle. Note that N and theta
   are not unique.

   Let

      C = cos(theta/2)
      S = sin(theta/2)

   Then the unit quaternions Q corresponding to M are

      Q = +/- ( C, S*n1, S*n2, S*n3 )

   The mappings between quaternions and the corresponding rotations
   are carried out by the CSPICE routines

      <a href="q2m_c.html">q2m_c</a> {quaternion to matrix}
      <a href="m2q_c.html">m2q_c</a> {matrix to quaternion}

   <a href="m2q_c.html">m2q_c</a> always returns a quaternion with scalar part greater than
   or equal to zero.


   SPICE Quaternion Multiplication Formula
   ---------------------------------------

   Given a SPICE quaternion

      Q = ( q0, q1, q2, q3 )

   corresponding to rotation axis A and angle theta as above, we can
   represent Q using &quot;scalar + vector&quot; notation as follows:

      s =   q0           = cos(theta/2)

      v = ( q1, q2, q3 ) = sin(theta/2) * A

      Q = s + v

   Let Q1 and Q2 be SPICE quaternions with respective scalar
   and vector parts s1, s2 and v1, v2:

      Q1 = s1 + v1
      Q2 = s2 + v2

   We represent the dot product of v1 and v2 by

      &lt;v1, v2&gt;

   and the cross product of v1 and v2 by

      v1 x v2

   Then the SPICE quaternion product is

      Q1*Q2 = s1*s2 - &lt;v1,v2&gt;  + s1*v2 + s2*v1 + (v1 x v2)

   If Q1 and Q2 represent the rotation matrices M1 and M2
   respectively, then the quaternion product

      Q1*Q2

   represents the matrix product

      M1*M2
