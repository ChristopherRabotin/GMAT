<PRE>
   inst        is the NAIF integer ID for the instrument, spacecraft, or
               other structure for which pointing is being requested.
               For brevity we will refer to this object as the
               &quot;instrument,&quot; and the frame fixed to this object as the
               &quot;instrument frame&quot; or &quot;instrument-fixed&quot; frame.

   sclkdp      is the encoded spacecraft clock time for which
               pointing is being requested.

               The CSPICE routines <a href="scencd_c.html">scencd_c</a> and <a href="sce2c_c.html">sce2c_c</a> respectively
               convert spacecraft clock strings and ephemeris time
               to encoded spacecraft clock. The inverse conversions
               are performed by <a href="scdecd_c.html">scdecd_c</a> and <a href="sct2e_c.html">sct2e_c</a>.

   tol         is a time tolerance in ticks, the units of encoded
               spacecraft clock time.

               The CSPICE routine <a href="sctiks_c.html">sctiks_c</a> converts a spacecraft clock
               tolerance duration from its character string
               representation to ticks. <a href="scfmt_c.html">scfmt_c</a> performs the inverse
               conversion.

               The C-matrix returned by <b>ckgp_c</b> is the one whose time tag
               is closest to `sclkdp' and within `tol' units of
               `sclkdp'. (More in -Particulars, below.)

               In general, because using a non-zero tolerance
               affects selection of the segment from which the
               data is obtained, users are strongly discouraged
               from using a non-zero tolerance when reading CKs
               with continuous data. Using a non-zero tolerance
               should be reserved exclusively to reading CKs with
               discrete data because in practice obtaining data
               from such CKs using a zero tolerance is often not
               possible due to time round off.

   ref         is the desired reference frame for the returned pointing.
               The returned C-matrix `cmat' gives the orientation of the
               instrument designated by `inst' relative to the frame
               designated by `ref'. When a vector specified relative to
               frame `ref' is left-multiplied by `cmat', the vector is
               rotated to the frame associated with `inst'. See the
               discussion of `cmat' below for details.

               Consult the SPICE document &quot;Frames&quot; for a discussion
               of supported reference frames.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
   cmat        is a rotation matrix that transforms the components of a
               vector expressed in the frame specified by `ref' to
               components expressed in the frame tied to the instrument,
               spacecraft, or other structure at time `clkout' (see
               below).

               Thus, if a vector v has components x,y,z in the `ref'
               reference frame, then v has components x',y',z' in the
               instrument fixed frame at time `clkout':

                  .-   -.     .-        -. .-   -.
                  |  x' |     |          | |  x  |
                  |  y' |  =  |   cmat   | |  y  |
                  |  z' |     |          | |  z  |
                  '-   -'     '-        -' '-   -'

               If you know x', y', z', use the transpose of the
               C-matrix to determine x, y, z as follows:

                  .-   -.      .-        -.T  .-   -.
                  |  x  |      |          |   |  x' |
                  |  y  |  =   |   cmat   |   |  y' |
                  |  z  |      |          |   |  z' |
                  '-   -'      '-        -'   '-   -'

                         (Transpose of `cmat')

   clkout      is the encoded spacecraft clock time associated with
               the returned C-matrix. This value may differ from the
               requested time, but never by more than the input
               tolerance `tol'.

               The -Particulars section below describes the search
               algorithm used by <b>ckgp_c</b> to satisfy a pointing request.
               This algorithm determines the pointing instance
               (and therefore the associated time value) that is
               returned.

   found       is SPICETRUE if a record was found to satisfy the
               pointing request.  `found' will be SPICEFALSE otherwise.

   How the tolerance argument is used
   ==================================


   Reading a type 1 CK segment (discrete pointing instances)
   ---------------------------------------------------------

   In the diagram below

      - &quot;0&quot; is used to represent discrete pointing instances
        (quaternions and associated time tags).

      - &quot;( )&quot; are used to represent the end points of the time
        interval covered by a segment in a CK file.

      - `sclkdp' is the time at which you requested pointing.
        The location of `sclkdp' relative to the time tags of the
        pointing instances is indicated by the &quot;+&quot; sign.

      - `tol' is the time tolerance specified in the pointing
        request. The square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot; represent the
        endpoints of the time interval

           sclkdp-tol : sclkdp+tol

      - The quaternions occurring in the segment need not be
        evenly spaced in time.


   Case 1:  pointing is available
   ------------------------------

                            sclkdp
                                 \   tol
                                  | /
                                  |/\
   Your request                [--+--]
                               .  .  .
   Segment      (0-----0--0--0--0--0--0---0--0------------0--0--0--0)
                                   ^
                                   |
                       <b>ckgp_c</b> returns this instance.


   Case 2:  pointing is not available
   ----------------------------------

                                                 sclkdp
                                                    \   tol
                                                     | /
                                                     |/\
   Your request                                   [--+--]
                                                  .  .  .
   Segment      (0-----0--0--0--0--0--0---0--0--0---------0--0--0--0)


                       <b>ckgp_c</b> returns no pointing; the output
                       `found' flag is set to SPICEFALSE.



   Reading a type 2, 3, 4, or 5 CK segment (continuous pointing)
   -------------------------------------------------------------

   In the diagrams below

      - &quot;==&quot; is used to represent periods of continuous pointing.

      - &quot;--&quot; is used to represent gaps in the pointing coverage.

      - &quot;( )&quot; are used to represent the end points of the time
        interval covered by a segment in a CK file.

      - `sclkdp' is the time at which you requested pointing.
        The location of `sclkdp' relative to the time tags of the
        pointing instances is indicated by the &quot;+&quot; sign.

      - `tol' is the time tolerance specified in the pointing
        request. The square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot; represent the
        endpoints of the time interval

           sclkdp-tol : sclkdp+tol

      - The quaternions occurring in the periods of continuous
        pointing need not be evenly spaced in time.


   Case 1:  pointing is available at the request time
   --------------------------------------------------

                           sclkdp
                                 \   tol
                                  | /
                                  |/\
   Your request                [--+--]
                               .  .  .

                               .  .  .
   Segment            (==---===========---=======----------===--)
                                  ^
                                  |

                 The request time lies within an interval where
                 continuous pointing is available. <b>ckgp_c</b> returns
                 pointing at the requested epoch.


   Case 2:  pointing is available &quot;near&quot; the request time
   ------------------------------------------------------

                                  sclkdp
                                        \   tol
                                         | /
                                         |/\
   Your request                       [--+--]

   Segment            (==---===========----=======---------===--)
                                           ^
                                           |

                 The request time lies in a gap: an interval where
                 continuous pointing is *not* available. <b>ckgp_c</b>
                 returns pointing for the epoch closest to the
                 request time `sclkdp'.


   Case 3:  pointing is not available
   ----------------------------------

                                               sclkdp
                                                     \   tol

   Segment            (==---===========----=======---------===--)

                       <b>ckgp_c</b> returns no pointing; the output
                       `found' flag is set to SPICEFALSE.



   Tolerance and segment priority
   ==============================

   <b>ckgp_c</b> searches through loaded C-kernels to satisfy a pointing
   request. Last-loaded files are searched first. Individual files are
   searched in backwards order, so that between competing segments
   (segments containing data for the same object, for overlapping time
   ranges), the one closest to the end of the file has highest
   priority.

   The search ends when a segment is found that can provide pointing
   for the specified instrument at a time falling within the specified
   tolerance on either side of the request time. Within that segment,
   the instance closest to the input time is located and returned.

   The following four cases illustrate this search procedure. Segments
   A and B are in the same file, with segment A located further
   towards the end of the file than segment B. Both segments A and B
   contain discrete pointing data, indicated by the number 0.


   Case 1:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
            Because segment A has the highest priority and can
            satisfy the request, segment B is not searched.


                                sclkdp
                                      \  tol

   Segments that contain continuous pointing data are searched in the
   same manner as segments containing discrete pointing data. For
   request times that fall within the bounds of continuous intervals,
   <b>ckgp_c</b> will return pointing at the request time. When the request
   time does not fall within an interval, then a time at an endpoint of
   an interval may be returned if it is the closest time in the segment
   to the user request time and is also within the tolerance.

   In the following examples, segment A is located further towards the
   end of the file than segment C. Segment A contains discrete pointing
   data and segment C contains continuous data, indicated by the &quot;=&quot;
   character.


   Case 3:  Pointing is not available in the first segment searched.
            Because segment A cannot satisfy the request, segment C
            is searched.

   In the next case, assume that the order of segments A and C in the
   file is reversed: A is now closer to the front, so data from
   segment C are considered first.


   Case 4:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
            Because segment C has the highest priority and can
            satisfy the request, segment A is not searched.

   The next case illustrates an unfortunate side effect of using
   a non-zero tolerance when reading multi-segment CKs with
   continuous data. In all cases when the look-up interval
   formed using tolerance overlaps a segment boundary and
   the request time falls within the coverage of the lower
   priority segment, the data at the end of the higher priority
   segment will be picked instead of the data from the lower
   priority segment.


   Case 5:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
            Because segment C has the highest priority and can
            satisfy the request, segment A is not searched.

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input,
   the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine specific
   arithmetic implementation.

   1) The following example program uses <b>ckgp_c</b> to get C-matrices for a
      set of images whose SCLK counts (un-encoded character string
      versions) are contained in the array `sclkch'.

      If available, the program will get the corrected pointing values.

      For each C-matrix, a unit pointing vector is constructed and
      printed.

      Use the CK kernel below to load the CASSINI image navigated
      spacecraft pointing and orientation data.

         04153_04182ca_ISS.bc


      Use the SCLK kernel below to load the CASSINI spacecraft clock
      time correlation data required for the conversion between
      spacecraft clock string representation and double precision
      encoding of spacecraft clock counts.
