   et          is a double precision representation of time in seconds
               past the ephemeris epoch J2000.

   pictur      is a string that specifies how the output should be
               presented. The string is made up of various markers
               that stand for various components associated with
               a time.

               There are five types of markers that may appear in a
               format picture. These are String Markers, Numeric
               Markers, Meta markers, Modifier Markers and Literal
               Markers.

               The `pictur' string is examined and the various markers
               are identified. The output time string is constructed
               by replacing each of the identified markers with
               an appropriate time component.

               The various markers and their meanings are discussed
               in the -Particulars section below.

               Note that leading and trailing blanks in `pictur' are
               ignored.

   outlen      is the maximum allowed length of the output string
               `output'. This length must be large enough to hold the
               output string plus the null-terminator character. If the
               output string is expected to have N characters, `outlen'
               should be at least N+1.

   1)  A leapseconds kernel must be loaded via the routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>
       before calling this routine. If a leapsecond kernel has not
       been loaded, an error is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   2)  If `pictur' contains the numeric marker &quot;YYYY&quot; and the magnitude
       of year is too large to be displayed as a four-digit integer,
       <b>timout_c</b> will replace it by &quot;****&quot;.

   3)  If the requested precision is higher than 12 decimal places,
       <b>timout_c</b> will truncate the decimal part down to 12, and `output'
       will have all the remaining digits in the decimal part set to
       zero.

   4)  Double colon (::), when is not part of one of the supported
       markers, has no effect and will be presented as is on the
       output string.

   5)  If the `pictur' input string pointer is null, the error
       SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled.

   6)  If the `pictur' input string has zero length, the error
       SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled.

   7)  If the `output' output string pointer is null, the error
       SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled.

   8)  If the `output' output string has length less than two
       characters, the error SPICE(STRINGTOOSHORT) is signaled, since
       the output string is too short to contain one character of
       output data plus a null terminator.

   A format picture is simply a string of letters that lets
   <b>timout_c</b> know where various components of a time representation
   should be placed during creation of the time string.
   Here's an example of such a picture:

      MON DD,YYYY  HR:MN:SC.#### (TDB) ::TDB

   Here is a sample of times that would be created by using this
   format.

      JAN 12,1992  12:28:18.2772 (TDB)
      FEB 13,1994  23:18:25.2882 (TDB)
      AUG 21,1995  00:02:00.1881 (TDB)

   As you can see from the samples above, the format picture
   specifies that every time string created should begin with a
   three-letter abbreviation for the month, followed by a space and
   the day of the month. The day of month is followed immediately by
   a comma and the year. The year component is followed by two
   spaces. The next outputs are hours represented as a two digit
   integer, a colon, minutes represented as a two digit integer,
   another colon, and seconds truncated to 4 decimal places and
   having a two digit integer part (rounding can be commanded; see
   the discussion of truncation and rounding below). This is
   followed by a space and the string &quot;(TDB)&quot;. The special marker
   &quot;::TDB&quot; in the time picture is a ``invisible'' marker. It is
   used to specify the time system that should be used in creating
   the time string (in this case Barycentric Dynamical Time).

   <b>timout_c</b> does not recognize all of the parts of the time format
   picture in the example above. The list of recognized parts and
   unrecognized parts is shown in the table below.

     Recognized       Unrecognized
     ----------       ------------
     &quot;MON&quot;            &quot; &quot;
     &quot;DD&quot;             &quot;,&quot;
     &quot;YYYY&quot;           &quot;  &quot;
     &quot;HR&quot;             &quot;:&quot;
     &quot;MN&quot;             &quot;(TDB)&quot;
     &quot;SC&quot;
     &quot;.####&quot;
     &quot;::TDB&quot;

   The unrecognized parts are called literal markers. They are
   copied exactly as they appear in `pictur' into the output string.
   The recognized parts of the picture are replaced by a
   component of time or, as in the case of &quot;::TDB&quot; are used
   as instructions about the overall properties of the time
   string.

   The full list of recognized markers, their classification
   and meaning are given below.

   String Markers

      String markers are portions of the format picture that will
      be replaced with a character string that represents the
      corresponding component of a time.

   Numeric Markers

      Numeric markers are portions of the format picture that will
      be replaced with a decimal string that represents the
      corresponding component of a time.

   Meta Markers

      Meta markers (listed under the class ``meta'' in the
      table above) are used to indicate &quot;global&quot; properties of
      your time string. You may specify time scale and how
      rounding should be performed on the components of time
      in your output string. Meta markers may be placed anywhere
      in your format picture. They do not contribute to placement
      of characters in output time strings. Also there are no
      restrictions on how many meta markers you may place in
      the format picture. However, if you supply conflicting
      `meta' markers (for example &quot;::TDT&quot; and &quot;::TDB&quot;) in your
      picture the first marker listed (in left to right order)
      overrules the conflicting marker that appears later in
      the picture.

   Default Meta Markers

      If you do not specify a time system, calendar, or time
      zone through the use of a Meta Marker, <b>timout_c</b> uses the
      values returned by the SPICE routine <a href="timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a>. The default
      time system, calendar returned by <a href="timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a> are UTC and
      the Gregorian calendar. The default time zone returned
      by <a href="timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a> is a blank indicating that no time zone offset
      should be used.

      See the header for the routine <a href="timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a> for a more complete
      discussion of setting and retrieving default values.

   Modifier Markers

      The numeric markers listed in the table above stand
      for integers unless they are modified through use of a
      modifier marker. The strings

         .#
         .##
         .###
         .####

      are used to this end. When a numeric marker is followed
      immediately by one of these modifiers, the corresponding time
      component will be written with the number of decimal places
      indicated by the number of successive occurrences of the
      character '#'. Any numeric token may be modified.

   Rounding vs. Truncation

      The meta markers ::TRNC and ::RND allow you to control
      how the output time picture is rounded. If you specify
      ::TRNC all components of time are simply truncated to
      the precision specified by the marker and any modifier.
      If you specify ::RND the output time is rounded to the
      least significant component of the format picture. The
      default action is truncation.

      Whether an output time string should be rounded or
      truncated depends upon what you plan to do with the
      string. For example suppose you simply want to get the
      calendar date associated with a time and not the time of
      day. Then you probably do not want to round your output.
      Rounding 1992 Dec 31, 13:12:00 to the nearest day
      produces 1993 Jan 1. Thus in this case rounding is probably
      not appropriate.

      However, if you are producing output for plotting using
      Julian Date, seconds past 1950 or seconds past 2000, you will
      probably want your output rounded so as to produce a smoother
      plot.

   Time Systems

      <b>timout_c</b> can produce output strings for epochs relative to
      any of the systems UTC, TT or TDT, or TDB. If you do not
      explicitly specify a time system, <b>timout_c</b> will produce strings
      relative to the time system returned by the SPICE routine
      <a href="timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a>. Unless you call <a href="timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a> and change it, the default time
      system is UTC. However, by using one of the Meta Markers
      ::UTC, ::TT, ::TDT, or ::TDB you may specify that <b>timout_c</b>
      produce time strings relative to the UTC, TT or TDT, or TDB
      system respectively.

   Time Zones

      The meta markers ::UTC+h:m  and ::UTC-h:m  allow you to
      offset UTC times so that you may represent times in a time
      zone other than GMT. For example you can output times in
      Pacific Standard time by placing the meta-marker ::UTC-8 in
      your format picture.

      For instance, if you use the picture

         YYYY Mon DD, HR:MN:SC ::UTC

      you will get output strings such as:

         1995 Jan 03, 12:00:00

      If you use the picture


         YYYY Mon DD, HR:MN:SC ::UTC-8

      you will get output strings such as:

         1995 Jan 03, 04:00:00

      Finally, if you use the picture

         YYYY Mon DD, HR:MN:SC ::UTC-8:15

      you will get output string

         1995 Jan 03, 03:45:00

      Note that the minutes are always added or subtracted based on
      the sign present in the time zone specifier. In the case of
      ::UTC+h:m, minutes are added. In the case ::UTC-h:m, minutes
      are subtracted.

      The unsigned part of the hours component can be no more than
      12. The unsigned part of the minutes component can be no

      The calendar currently used by western countries is the
      Gregorian calendar. This calendar begins on Oct 15, 1582.
      Prior to Gregorian calendar the Julian calendar was used. The
      last Julian calendar date prior to the beginning of the
      Gregorian calendar is Oct 5, 1582.

      The primary difference between the Julian and Gregorian
      calendars is in the determination of leap years. Nevertheless,
      both can be formally extended backward and forward in time
      indefinitely.

      By default <b>timout_c</b> uses the default calendar returned by
      <a href="timdef_c.html">timdef_c</a>. Under most circumstances this will be the Gregorian
      calendar (::GCAL). However you may specify that <b>timout_c</b> use a
      specific calendar through use of one of the calendar Meta
      Markers. You may specify that <b>timout_c</b> use the Julian calendar
      (::JCAL), the Gregorian calendar (::GCAL)  or a mixture of
      both (::MCAL).

      If you specify ::MCAL, epochs that occur after the beginning
      of the Gregorian calendar will be represented using the
      Gregorian calendar, and epochs prior to the beginning of the
      Gregorian calendar will be represented using the Julian
      calendar.

   Getting Software to Construct Pictures for You.

      Although it is not difficult to construct time format
      pictures, you do need to be aware of the various markers that
      may appear in a format picture.

      There is an alternative means for getting a format picture.
      The routine <a href="tpictr_c.html">tpictr_c</a> constructs format pictures from a sample
      time string. For example, suppose you would like your time
      strings to look like the basic pattern of the string below.

         &quot;Fri Jul 26 12:22:09 PDT 1996&quot;

      You can call <a href="tpictr_c.html">tpictr_c</a> with this string, and it will create the
      appropriate `pictur' for use with <b>timout_c</b>.

         <a href="tpictr_c.html">tpictr_c</a> ( &quot;Fri Jul 26 12:22:09 PDT 1996&quot;, LENPIC, LENERR,
                    pictur, &amp;ok, errmsg );

      The result will be:

         &quot;Wkd Mon DD HR:MN:SC (PDT) ::UTC-7&quot;

      Note: not every date that you can read is interpretable by
      <a href="tpictr_c.html">tpictr_c</a>. For example, you might be able to understand that
      19960212121116 is Feb 2 1996, 12:11:16. However, <a href="tpictr_c.html">tpictr_c</a>
      cannot recognize this string. Thus it is important to check
      the logical output OK to make sure that <a href="tpictr_c.html">tpictr_c</a> was able to
      understand the time picture you provided.

      Even thought <a href="tpictr_c.html">tpictr_c</a> can not recognize every time pattern that
      has been used by various people, it does recognize nearly all
      patterns that you use when you want to communicate outside
      your particular circle of colleagues.

   The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input,
   the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine specific
   arithmetic implementation.

   1) Given a sample with the format of the UNIX date string
      local to California, create a SPICE time picture for use
      in <b>timout_c</b>.

      Using that SPICE time picture, convert a series of ephemeris
      times to that picture format.

      Use the LSK kernel below to load the leap seconds and time
      constants required for the conversions.

         if ( ! ok )
         {

            printf( &quot;Invalid time picture.\n&quot; );
            printf( &quot;%s\n&quot;, err );

         }
         else

            /.
            Now convert `et' to the desired output format.

         }

         return ( 0 );
      }


      When this program was executed on a Mac/Intel/cc/64-bit
      platform, the output was:

      Output       :  Sat Mar 24 09:23:00 PDT 2018


   2) Convert a UTC time to a string that contains both the
      calendar representations of the date as well as the Julian
      date; for example a string of the form:

       Changed the input argument name &quot;lenout&quot; to &quot;outlen&quot; for
       consistency with other routines.

       Corrected typo preventing correct calculation of decimal
       values for HR.###... and MN.###... markers with ::UTC+N:M
       and ::UTC-N:M meta tags.

       Added &quot;::TT&quot; as a time system meta marker equivalent-to/
       alias-for &quot;::TDT&quot;. No change to functionality.

       Edited the header to comply with NAIF standard. Converted the
       existing code fragments into complete examples and added
       references to required LSKs.

       Updated -Exceptions section, rewording the existing entry
       and adding three additional cases. Fixed call to <a href="tpictr_c.html">tpictr_c</a> in
       -Particulars.

       Corrected header example string: changed token HH to HR.

       Updated &quot;output&quot; argument description in -Detailed_Output.

   -CSPICE Version 1.1.1, 14-AUG-2006 (EDW)

       Edited incorrect description of output. Replace mention of
       <a href="ldpool_c.html">ldpool_c</a> with <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   -CSPICE Version 1.1.0, 09-FEB-1998 (NJB)

       Re-implemented routine without dynamically allocated, temporary
       strings. Updated the -Exceptions header section.
