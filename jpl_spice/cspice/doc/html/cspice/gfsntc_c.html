   target      is the string name of a target body. Optionally, you may
               supply the integer ID code for the object as an
               integer string. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot;
               are legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
               target body.

               On calling <b>gfsntc_c</b>, the kernel pool must contain the radii
               data corresponding to `target'.

   fixref      is the string name of the body-fixed, body-centered
               reference frame associated with the target body `target'.

               The SPICE frame subsystem must recognize the `fixref'
               name.

   method      is the string name of the method to use for the surface
               intercept calculation. The accepted values for `method':

                  &quot;Ellipsoid&quot;        The intercept computation uses
                                     a triaxial ellipsoid to model
                                     the surface of the target body.
                                     The ellipsoid's radii must be
                                     available in the kernel pool.

               The `method' string lacks sensitivity to case, embedded,
               leading and trailing blanks.

   abcorr      is the string description of the aberration corrections
               to apply to the state evaluations to account for one-way
               light time and stellar aberration.

               Any aberration correction accepted by the SPICE
               routine <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> is accepted here. See the header
               of <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> for a detailed description of the
               aberration correction options. For convenience,
               the options are listed below:

                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction. Returns the &quot;true&quot;
                             geometric state.

                  &quot;LT&quot;       &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  &quot;LT+S&quot;     &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  &quot;CN&quot;       &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  &quot;CN+S&quot;     &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

                  &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  &quot;XLT+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  &quot;XCN&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  &quot;XCN+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

               The `abcorr' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

               *Note*

               When using a reference frame defined as a dynamic frame,
               the user should realize defining an aberration correction
               for the search different from that in the frames
               definition will affect the search results.

               In general, use the same aberration correction for
               intercept point searches as used in the definition of a
               dynamic frame (if applicable).

   obsrvr      is the string name of an observing body. Optionally, you
               may supply the ID code of the object as an integer
               string. For example, both &quot;EARTH&quot; and &quot;399&quot; are
               legitimate strings to indicate the observer as Earth.

   dref        is the string name of the reference frame corresponding
               to `dvec'.

               The `dref' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

   dvec        is the pointing or boresight vector from the observer.
               The intercept of this vector and `target' is the event of
               interest.

   crdsys      is the string name of the coordinate system for which the
               coordinate of interest is a member.

   coord       is the string name of the coordinate of interest in
               `crdsys'.

               The supported coordinate systems and coordinate names:

                  crdsys             coord               Range

                                     &quot;ALTITUDE&quot;

               The &quot;ALTITUDE&quot; coordinates have a constant value of
               zero +/- roundoff for ellipsoid targets.

               Limit searches for coordinate events in the &quot;GEODETIC&quot;
               and &quot;PLANETOGRAPHIC&quot; coordinate systems to `target' bodies
               with axial symmetry in the equatorial plane, i.e.
               equality of the body X and Y radii (oblate or prolate
               spheroids).

               Searches on &quot;GEODETIC&quot; or &quot;PLANETOGRAPHIC&quot; coordinates
               requires body shape data, and in the case of
               &quot;PLANETOGRAPHIC&quot; coordinates, body rotation data.

               The body associated with &quot;GEODETIC&quot; or &quot;PLANETOGRAPHIC&quot;
               coordinates is the center of the frame `fixref'.

   relate      is the string or character describing the relational
               operator used to define a constraint on the selected
               coordinate of the surface intercept vector. The result
               window found by this routine indicates the time intervals
               where the constraint is satisfied. Supported values of
               `relate' and corresponding meanings are shown below:

                  &quot;&gt;&quot;        The coordinate value is greater than the
                             reference value `refval'.

                  &quot;=&quot;        The coordinate value is equal to the
                             reference value `refval'.

                  &quot;&lt;&quot;        The coordinate value is less than the
                             reference value `refval'.

                  &quot;ABSMAX&quot;   The coordinate value is at an absolute
                             maximum.

                  &quot;ABSMIN&quot;   The coordinate value is at an absolute
                             minimum.

                  &quot;LOCMAX&quot;   The coordinate value is at a local
                             maximum.

                  &quot;LOCMIN&quot;   The coordinate value is at a local
                             minimum.

               The caller may indicate that the region of interest
               is the set of time intervals where the quantity is
               within a specified measure of an absolute extremum.
               The argument `adjust' (described below) is used to
               specify this measure.

               Local extrema are considered to exist only in the
               interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement
               window:  a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary
               point of the confinement window.

               The `relate' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

   refval      is the double precision reference value used together
               with the argument `relate' to define an equality or
               inequality to satisfy by the selected coordinate of the
               surface intercept vector. See the discussion of `relate'
               above for further information.

               The units of `refval' correspond to the type as defined
               by `coord', radians for angular measures, kilometers for
               distance measures.

   adjust      is a double precision value used to modify searches for
               absolute extrema: when `relate' is set to &quot;ABSMAX&quot; or
               &quot;ABSMIN&quot; and `adjust' is set to a positive value, <b>gfsntc_c</b>
               finds times when the intercept vector coordinate is
               within `adjust' radians/kilometers of the specified extreme
               value.

               For `relate' set to &quot;ABSMAX&quot;, the `result' window contains
               time intervals when the intercept vector coordinate has
               values between absmax - adjust and `absmax'.

               For `relate' set to &quot;ABSMIN&quot;, the `result' window contains
               time intervals when the intercept vector coordinate has
               values between `absmin' and absmin + adjust.

               `adjust' is not used for searches for local extrema,
               equality or inequality conditions.

   step        is the double precision time step size to use in the
               search.

               Selection of the time step for surface intercept geometry
               requires consideration of the mechanics of a surface
               intercept event. In most cases, two distinct searches
               will be needed, one to determine the windows when the
               boresight vector intercepts the surface and then the
               search based on the user defined constraints within those
               windows. The boresight of nadir pointing instrument may
               continually intercept a body, but an instrument scanning
               across a disc will have configurations when the
               boresight does not intercept the body.

               The step size must be smaller than the shortest interval
               within the confinement window over which the intercept
               exists and also smaller than the shortest interval over
               which the intercept does not exist.

               For coordinates other than LONGITUDE and RIGHT ASCENSION,
               the step size must be shorter than the shortest interval,
               within the confinement window, over which the coordinate
               is monotone increasing or decreasing.

               For LONGITUDE and RIGHT ASCENSION, the step size must
               be shorter than the shortest interval, within the
               confinement window, over which either the sine or cosine
               of the coordinate is monotone increasing or decreasing.

               The choice of `step' affects the completeness but not
               the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
               precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
               See the discussion of the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL for
               details.

               `step' has units of TDB seconds.

   nintvls     is an integer parameter specifying the number of intervals
               that can be accommodated by each of the dynamically allocated
               workspace windows used internally by this routine.

               In many cases, it's not necessary to compute an accurate
               estimate of how many intervals are needed; rather, the user
               can pick a size considerably larger than what's really
               required.

               However, since excessively large arrays can prevent
               applications from compiling, linking, or running properly,
               sometimes `nintvls' must be set according to the actual
               workspace requirement. A rule of thumb for the number of
               intervals needed is

                  nintvls  =  2*n  +  ( m / step )

               where

                  n      is the number of intervals in the confinement
                         window.

                  m      is the measure of the confinement window, in units
                         of seconds.

                  step   is the search step size in seconds.

   cnfine      is a double precision SPICE window that confines the time
               period over which the specified search is conducted.
               `cnfine' may consist of a single interval or a collection
               of intervals.

               In some cases the confinement window can be used to
               greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
               for the desired solution. See the -Particulars section
               below for further discussion.

               See the -Examples section below for a code example
               that shows how to create a confinement window.

               In some cases the observer's state may be computed at
               times outside of `cnfine' by as much as 2 seconds. See
               -Particulars for details.

               `cnfine' must be declared as a double precision SpiceCell.

   cnfine      is the input confinement window, updated if necessary so the

               and cardinality. The window data are unchanged.

   result      is the SPICE window of intervals, contained within the

               `result' must be declared and initialized with sufficient
               size to capture the full set of time intervals within the

               If `result' is non-empty on input, its contents will be

               The endpoints of the time intervals comprising `result' are
               interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.

               If the search is for local extrema, or for absolute
               extrema with `adjust' set to zero, then normally each
               interval of `result' will be a singleton: the left and
               right endpoints of each interval will be identical.

               If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
               search criteria, `result' will be returned with a

                     SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is also used for finding intermediate

      a chain connecting the targets and observer that cover the
      time period specified by the window `cnfine'. If aberration

   This routine provides a simpler, but less flexible interface
   than does the routine <a href="gfevnt_c.html">gfevnt_c</a> for conducting searches for
   surface intercept vector coordinate value events.
   Applications that require support for progress reporting,
   interrupt handling, non-default step or refinement functions, or
   non-default convergence tolerance should call <a href="gfevnt_c.html">gfevnt_c</a> rather than
   this routine.

   This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
   within the confinement window when the selected coordinate of
   the surface intercept position vector satisfies a caller-specified
   constraint. The resulting set of intervals is returned as a SPICE
   window.

   Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
   solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
   use of this routine in user applications.


   The Search Process
   ==================

   Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this
   routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time
   periods, within the confinement window, over which the specified
   coordinate function is monotone increasing and monotone
   decreasing. Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE
   window. Having found these windows, all of the coordinate
   function's local extrema within the confinement window are known.
   Absolute extrema then can be found very easily.

   Within any interval of these &quot;monotone&quot; windows, there will be at
   most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary
   of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in
   the union of

   -  the set of points where an equality constraint is met

   -  the boundary points of the confinement window

   the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be
   found easily once the monotone windows have been found.


   Step Size
   =========

   The monotone windows (described above) are found using a two-step
   search process. Each interval of the confinement window is
   searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to
   determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of
   change of coordinate will be sampled. Starting at
   the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be taken at each
   step. If a change of sign is found, a root has been bracketed; at
   that point, the time at which the time derivative of the
   coordinate is zero can be found by a refinement process, for
   example, using a binary search.

   Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
   of the intervals over which the coordinate function is monotone:
   the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these
   intervals (within the confinement window).

   The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths
   of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if
   the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the
   shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size
   of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the
   result window. In situations like this, the technique of using
   monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a
   state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the
   specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can
   miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the
   shortest solution interval.

   Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target and
   observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
   In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
   picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
   time.

   Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
   the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
   That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


   Convergence Tolerance
   =====================

   Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
   narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
   This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
   has been determined to within an error margin called the
   &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The default convergence tolerance
   used by this routine is set by the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL (defined
   in SpiceGF.h).

   The value of SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
   tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
   solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
   data will be the limiting factor.

   The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol_c.html">gfstol_c</a>, e.g.

      <a href="gfstol_c.html">gfstol_c</a> ( tolerance value );

   Call <a href="gfstol_c.html">gfstol_c</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
   searches will use the updated tolerance value.

   Setting the tolerance tighter than SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is unlikely to be
   useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
   Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
   since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
   cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect
   on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


   The Confinement Window
   ======================

   The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
   interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
   confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
   more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
   to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
   slow search of interest must be performed.

   Practical use of the coordinate search capability would likely
   consist of searches over multiple coordinate constraints to find
   time intervals that satisfies the constraints. An
   effective technique to accomplish such a search is
   to use the result window from one search as the confinement window
   of the next.

   Certain types of searches require the state of the observer,
   relative to the solar system barycenter, to be computed at times
   slightly outside the confinement window `cnfine'. The time window
   that is actually used is the result of &quot;expanding&quot; `cnfine' by a
   specified amount &quot;T&quot;: each time interval of `cnfine' is expanded by
   shifting the interval's left endpoint to the left and the right
   endpoint to the right by T seconds. Any overlapping intervals are
   merged. (The input argument `cnfine' is not modified.)

   The window expansions listed below are additive: if both
   conditions apply, the window expansion amount is the sum of the
   individual amounts.

   -  If a search uses an equality constraint, the time window
      over which the state of the observer is computed is expanded
      by 1 second at both ends of all of the time intervals
      comprising the window over which the search is conducted.

   -  If a search uses stellar aberration corrections, the time
      window over which the state of the observer is computed is
      expanded as described above.

   When light time corrections are used, expansion of the search
   window also affects the set of times at which the light time-
   corrected state of the target is computed.

   In addition to the possible 2 second expansion of the search
   window that occurs when both an equality constraint and stellar
   aberration corrections are used, round-off error should be taken
   into account when the need for data availability is analyzed.

   Longitude and Right Ascension
   =============================

   The cyclic nature of the longitude and right ascension coordinates
   produces branch cuts at +/- 180 degrees longitude and 0-360
   longitude. Round-off error may cause solutions near these branches
   to cross the branch. Use of the SPICE routine <a href="wncond_c.html">wncond_c</a> will contract
   solution windows by some epsilon, reducing the measure of the
   windows and eliminating the branch crossing. A one millisecond
   contraction will in most cases eliminate numerical round-off
   caused branch crossings.

   2) Find the time during 2007 for which the intercept point on the
      earth of the sun-to-earth vector as described in Example 1 in
      the IAU_EARTH frame lies within a geodetic latitude-longitude
      &quot;box&quot; defined as

          16 degrees &lt;= latitude  &lt;= 17 degrees
          85 degrees &lt;= longitude &lt;= 86 degrees

      This problem requires four searches, each search on one of the
      box restrictions. The user needs also realize the temporal
      behavior of latitude greatly differs from that of the
      longitude. The intercept latitude varies between approximately
      23.44 degrees and -23.44 degrees during the year. The intercept
      longitude varies between -180 degrees and 180 degrees in one
      day.
