   inst        indicates the name of an instrument, such as a
               spacecraft-mounted framing camera. The field of view
               (FOV) of the instrument will be used to determine if
               the target is visible with respect to the instrument.

               The position of the instrument `inst' is considered to
               coincide with that of the ephemeris object `obsrvr' (see
               description below).

               The size of the instrument's FOV is constrained by the
               following: There must be a vector A such that all of
               the instrument's FOV boundary vectors have an angular
               separation from A of less than (pi/2)-SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians
               (see description below). For FOVs that are circular or
               elliptical, the vector A is the boresight. For FOVs
               that are rectangular or polygonal, the vector A is
               calculated.

               See the header of the CSPICE routine <a href="getfov_c.html">getfov_c</a> for a
               description of the required parameters associated with
               an instrument.

               Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
               example, both &quot;CASSINI_ISS_NAC&quot; and &quot;-82360&quot; are
               accepted. Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string.

   target      is the name of the target body. This routine determines
               if the target body appears in the instrument's field of
               view.

               Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
               example, both &quot;Moon&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are accepted. Case and
               leading or trailing blanks are not significant in the
               string.

   tshape      is a string indicating the geometric model used to
               represent the shape of the target body. The supported
               options are:

                  'ELLIPSOID'     Use a triaxial ellipsoid model,
                                  with radius values provided via the
                                  kernel pool. A kernel variable
                                  having a name of the form

                                     'BODYnnn_RADII'

                                  where nnn represents the NAIF
                                  integer code associated with the
                                  body, must be present in the kernel
                                  pool. This variable must be
                                  associated with three numeric
                                  values giving the lengths of the
                                  ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.

                  'POINT'         Treat the body as a single point.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string.

   tframe      is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
               frame associated with the target body. Examples of
               such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and 'ITRF93'
               (for the Earth).

               If the target body is modeled as a point, `tframe'
               is ignored and should be left blank. (Ex: &quot; &quot;).

               Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
               non-blank frame name are not significant in the string.

   abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
               when computing the target's position and orientation.

               For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
               position and orientation of the target seen by the
               observer are desired, normally either of the
               corrections:

                  &quot;LT+S&quot;
                  &quot;CN+S&quot;

               should be used. These and the other supported options
               are described below.

               Supported aberration correction options for
               observation (the case where radiation is received by
               observer at `et') are:

                  &quot;NONE&quot;         No correction.
                  &quot;LT&quot;           Light time only
                  &quot;LT+S&quot;         Light time and stellar aberration.
                  &quot;CN&quot;           Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                  &quot;CN+S&quot;         CN light time and stellar aberration.

               Supported aberration correction options for
               transmission (the case where radiation is emitted from
               observer at `et') are:

                  &quot;XLT&quot;          Light time only.
                  &quot;XLT+S&quot;        Light time and stellar aberration.
                  &quot;XCN&quot;          Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                  &quot;XCN+S&quot;        CN light time and stellar aberration.

               Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
               in the string.

   obsrvr      is the name of the body from which the target is
               observed. The instrument `inst' is treated as if it were
               co-located with the observer.

               Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
               example, both &quot;CASSINI&quot; and &quot;-82&quot; are accepted. Case
               and leading or trailing blanks are not significant in
               the string.

   et          is the observation time in seconds past the J2000
               epoch.

   visibl      is SPICETRUE if `target' is fully or partially in the

   SPICE_GF_MAXVRT   is the maximum number of vertices that may be used to
                     define the boundary of the specified instrument's field
                     of view. See the header file SpiceGF.h for details.

   SPICE_GF_MARGIN   is a small positive number used to constrain the
                     orientation of the boundary vectors of polygonal
                     FOVs. Such FOVs must satisfy the following constraints:

                        1)  The boundary vectors must be contained within
                            a right circular cone of angular radius less
                            than (pi/2) - SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians; in other
                            words, there must be a vector A such that all
                            boundary vectors have angular separation from
                            A of less than (pi/2)-SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians.

                        2)  There must be a pair of boundary vectors U, V
                            such that all other boundary vectors lie in the
                            same half space bounded by the plane containing
                            U and V. Furthermore, all other boundary vectors
                            must have orthogonal projections onto a specific
                            plane normal to this plane (the normal plane
                            contains the angle bisector defined by U and V)
                            such that the projections have angular
                            separation of at least 2*SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians
                            from the plane spanned by U and V.

                     SPICE_GF_MARGIN is currently set to 1.e-12.

   1)  If the name of either the target or observer cannot be
       translated to a NAIF ID code, an error is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   2)  If the specified aberration correction is an unrecognized
       value, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   3)  If the radii of a target body modeled as an ellipsoid cannot
       be determined by searching the kernel pool for a kernel
       variable having a name of the form

          &quot;BODYnnn_RADII&quot;

       where nnn represents the NAIF integer code associated with
       the body, an error is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   4)  If the target and observer bodies are the same, an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   5)  If the body model specifier `tshape' is invalid, an error is
       signaled by either this routine or a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   6)  If a target body-fixed reference frame associated with a
       non-point target is not recognized, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   7)  If a target body-fixed reference frame is not centered at the
       corresponding target body, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   8)  If the instrument name `inst' does not have a corresponding NAIF
       ID code, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   9)  If the FOV parameters of the instrument are not present in
       the kernel pool, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   10) If the FOV boundary has more than SPICE_GF_MAXVRT vertices, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   11) If the instrument FOV shape is a polygon or rectangle, and
       this routine cannot find a ray R emanating from the FOV vertex
       such that maximum angular separation of R and any FOV boundary
       vector is within the limit (pi/2)-SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If the
       FOV is any other shape, the same error check will be applied
       with the instrument boresight vector serving the role of R.

   12) If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute a
       requested state vector, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   13) If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file,
       the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   14) If any of the `inst', `target', `tshape', `abcorr', `obsrvr'
       or `tframe' input string pointers is null, the error
       SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled.

   15) If any of the `inst', `target', `tshape', `abcorr' or `obsrvr'
       input strings has zero length, the error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is
       signaled.

<h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4>
<PRE>
   Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
   before this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: ephemeris data for target and observer that
      describe the ephemerides of these objects at the time `et'.
      If aberration corrections are used, the states of
      target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
      must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.

   -  Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert
      the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of
      the target, that definition must be available in the kernel
      pool. Typically the definitions of frames not already
      built-in to SPICE are supplied by loading a frame kernel.

   -  Data defining the reference frame in which the instrument's
      FOV is defined must be available in the kernel pool. Additionally,
      the name `inst' must be associated with an ID code.

   -  IK data: the kernel pool must contain data such that
      the CSPICE routine <a href="getfov_c.html">getfov_c</a> may be called to obtain
      parameters for `inst'.

   The following data may be required:

   -  PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
      orientation data provided by variables in the kernel pool.

      Bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have radii
      lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool.

   -  CK data: if the frame in which the instrument's FOV is
      defined is fixed to a spacecraft, at least one CK file will
      be needed to permit transformation of vectors between that
      frame and both J2000 and the target body-fixed frame.

   -  SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
      kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
      (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
      (TDB).

   Kernel data are normally loaded via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> once per program run,
   NOT every time this routine is called.

         This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
         example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
         assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
         required by SPICE-based user applications.

         In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
         kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
         current working directory.

         The names and contents of the kernels referenced
         by this meta-kernel are as follows:

      When this program was executed on a Mac/Intel/cc/64-bit
      platform, the output was:


      At time 2010-OCT-06 17:09:45.346 (TDB) the following were
      in the field of view of CASSINI_ISS_NAC
        ENCELADUS
        JANUS
        EPIMETHEUS
        ATLAS
        PAN
        DAPHNIS
        ANTHE


      Note: there were actually 7 of Saturn's satellites in the
      field-of-view of Cassini's narrow-angle camera. However, Anthe
      is very small and was probably obscured by other objects or
      shadow.
