#   This script is a more or less generic library/executable
#   builder for CSPICE products.  It assumes that it is executed
#   from one of the "product" directories in a tree that looks like
#   the one displayed below:
#
#                      package
#                         |
#                         |
#       +------+------+------+------+------+
#       |      |      |      |      |      | 
#     data    doc    etc    exe    lib    src
#                                          |
#                                          |
#                         +----------+----------+------- ... ------+
#                         |          |          |                  |
#                     product_1  product_2  product_3    ...   product_n
#
#   Here's the basic strategy:
#
#     1)  Compile all of the .c files in the current directory
#
#     2)  If there are no .pgm files in the current directory this
#         is assumed to be a library source directory.  The name
#         of the library is the same as the name of the product.
#         The library is placed in the "lib" directory in the tree
#         above.  The script is then done.
# 
#         If there are .pgm files and there were some .c
#         files compiled the objects are gathered together in the
#         current directory into a library called locallib.a.
#
#     3)  If any *.pgm files exist in the current directory, compile 
#         them and add their objects to locallib.a.  Create a C main
#         program file from the uniform CSPICE main program main.x.
#         Compile this main program and link its object with locallib.a,
#         ../../cspice.a and ../../csupport.a. The output 
#         executables have an empty extension.  The executables are
#         placed in the "exe" directory in the tree above.
#         
#   The environment variable TKCOMPILEOPTIONS containing compile options 
#   is optionally set. If it is set prior to executing this script,
#   those options are used. It it is not set, it is set within this
#   script as a local variable.

#
#   Version 6.1.0  November 13, 2006  Boris Semenov
#
#      Updated for 64bit. Put -O2 back in.
#
#   Version 6.0.0  April 20, 2000  Bill Taber
#
#      Removed O2 optimization as it caused some loops to 
#      not terminate.    
#
#   Version 5.0.0  Feb. 09, 1999  Nat Bachman
#
#      Now uses O2 optimization.      
#
#   Version 4.0.0  Nov. 02, 1998  Nat Bachman
#
#      Updated to use an environment variable to designate the C
#      compiler to use.
#
#   Version 3.0.0  Oct. 31, 1998  Nat Bachman
#
#      Updated to make use of uniform C main routine main.x.
#
#   Version 2.0.0  Feb. 04, 1998  Nat Bachman
#
#      Modified to handle C code.  Sun/Solaris/Native cc Version.

#   If there are any main programs in the directory, prepare them
#   for use together with the "uniform" main.x routine.  We copy
#   each main program to a file whose name terminates in _main.c.
#   We then make a copy of main.x having its name made of the tail of
#   the original .pgm file and an extension of .px.  When we compile
#   the main programs, we'll look for this .px extension rather than
#   the orginal .pgm.
