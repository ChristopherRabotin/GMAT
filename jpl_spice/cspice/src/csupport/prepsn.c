/*      STRING    I/O  a string to be prepare for display */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     STRING     is a string that contains a META/2 syntax description. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     STRING     is the same string after having carriage return */
/*                markers inserted into it for use by display routines */
/*                NICEIO, NICEPR or NICEBT */

/* $ Parameters */

/*      MAXLEN    is the maximum length string that can be supported */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     Error free. */

/* $ Files */

/*      None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine allows you to easily prepare a META/2 syntax */
/*     specification for display using one of the routines NICEIO */
/*     NICEPR or NICEBT.  The routine steps through the input */
/*     routine a word at a time to locate the markers used in */
/*     META/2 switches.  It assumes the string '/cr' is used for */
/*     the new line marker within a string. */

/*     Newlines are always inserted at the beginning of a switch (x:y){, */
/*     after a switch separator '|' and after the end of a switch }. */
/*     Care is taken so that the construct */

/*       } (x:y){ */

/*     becomes */

/*       }/cr (x:y){ */

/*     and not */

/*       }/cr(x:y){ */

/*     or */

/*       }/cr/cr (x:y){ */

/* $ Examples */

/*     This routine is meant for internal use by the routine */
/*     META_2.  However, if you have a sequence of strings that */
/*     you would like to prepare for display in documentation */
/*     you might want to use this routine together with */
/*     NICEIO or one of its cousins for preparing your documentation. */
