/* $ Particulars */

/*     By combining the function of the entry points in this routine you */
/*     may create a page having fixed titles, headers, and footers. */
/*     together with a variable body for each page.  In addition you may */
/*     insert the current page number in either the title or footer */
/*     portion of each page.  In addition you may adjust the size of */
/*     each page and the width of the page. */

/*     In addition since the IO path has not been selected (you supply */
/*     your own routine for receiving lines for output.  You may be able */
/*     to use this routine to build up pages that you may then process */
/*     further adding touches to the output that have not been provided */
/*     here. */

/*     The capabilities provided are: */

/*     PAGRST   ---  sets the page number to zero, and empties all */
/*                   sections of the page format. It does not affect the */
/*                   global page properties such as the frequency of */
/*                   titles, headers and footers, page width and height. */

/*     PAGSCN   ---  allows you to set the section to which the next */
/*                   lines should be written. */

/*     PAGSET   ---  allows you to set page geometry and frequency */
/*                   parameters. */

/*     PAGSMK   ---  allows you to set the marker that indicates "put the */
/*                   current page number here." */

/*     PAGPUT   ---  allows you put a line of text on the page.  Note */
/*                   that the "printing" of title, header and footer */
/*                   text is deferred until the first line of text in */
/*                   the body is sent to PAGPUT. */

/*     PAGSFT   ---  is a soft page reset,  the page number is not */
/*                   altered but the current page is ended (causing a */
/*                   footer to be written if one is to be printed on the */
/*                   current page) and then empties the sections */
/*                   indicated so that they can be updated with new */
/*                   text. */

/*     PAGPMT   ---  allows you to determine if the last call to PAGPUT */
/*                   caused a prompt to be issued and if so to see what */
/*                   the user's response to that prompt was. */

/*                   Note that for a prompt to be issued you must take */
/*                   several steps. */

/*                   1) You must enable prompts through the PAGSET entry */
/*                      point. */

/*                      CALL PAGSET ( 'PROMPT', 0 ) */

/*                   2) You next need to set the prompt that will be used */
/*                      This is done with two calls. */

/*                      CALL PAGSCN ( 'PROMPT' ) */
/*                      CALL PAGPUT ( 'your prompt value:' ) */

/*                   Having made these preparations, the page manager is */
/*                   now ready to issue your prompt and retain the user's */
/*                   response when a page is finished. */

/*                   Note that prompts are not issued as a result of */
/*                   calling a page reset for (either soft or hard) */

/*                   Also note that once a reset is issued, the prompt */
/*                   status is set back to the default value --- No */
/*                   Prompts. */

/*     You might use this routine in conjunction with NICEPR, or TABRPT. */

/*     A typical useage might go as shown here. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     VALUE      is an integer indicating whether or not a prompt was */
/*                displayed and a value returned.  If no prompt was */
/*                issued on the last call to PAGPUT, VALUE will have the */
/*                value zero.  Otherwise VALUE will have some non-zero */
/*                value. */

/*     LINE       is the value of the prompt returned if there was one. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This entry point returns information about what happened in the */
/*     last call to PAGPUT.  If a page was finished and a prompt was */
/*     displayed and the user responded, this routine will return two */
/*     a non-zero integer for VALUE and will place the results of the */
/*     prompt in the string LINE. */

/*     Note that this routine will return the same results until some */
/*     call to PAGPUT is made again. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Suppose that you are using the page manager to send output */
/*     to some device.  But that you want to allow the user to */
/*     pause in the course of sending the output. The following */
/*     illustrates how you would do this. */

/*     CALL getnext  ( LINE, MORE ) */

/*     DO WHILE ( MORE ) */

/*        CALL PAGPUT ( LINE ) */
/*        CALL PAGPMT ( VALUE, RESPNS ) */

/*        IF ( VALUE .NE. 0 ) */

/*           take some action concerning RESPNS */

/*        END IF */

/*        CALL getnext  ( LINE, MORE ) */

/*     END DO */



/*     Alternatively you might like to just have the page manager */
/*     wait for the user after a page has been finished.  To do this */
/*     you could set things up as follows. */

/*     CALL PAGSET ( 'PROMPT', 0 ) */
/*     CALL PAGSCN ( 'PROMPT'    ) */
