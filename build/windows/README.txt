Microsoft Visual C++ build needs the environment variable WXWIN (wxWidgets directory).
It can be added from My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced Tab -> Environment Variables.
Add variable WXWIN and set value to directory where wxWidgets is installed, such as C:\wxWidgits-2.8.10.
Current GMAT development build uses wxWidgets-2.8.10 as of 2009.10.17.
