GMAT Installation for Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard)  (An Alpha Release)
---
Welcome to the wonderful world of GMAT!

This README file provides instructions for installing and launching the Mac version of GMAT, including guidelines for modifying environment variables when necessary.

The Mac version of GMAT is considered an alpha release.  The system has been tested extensively to validate script-based execution and numerical correctness, but the graphical user interface has only been lightly tested.The included Mac application bundle was built on Mac OS X 10.6.7 (Snow Leopard).  Files that are needed to run GMAT (startup and data files) are included, as are sample scripts and some GMAT plugins.  The build files and source code can be downloaded from the GMAT website:		http://gmat.gsfc.nasa.govor from Sourceforge:	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmat

GMAT for Mac is released as a g-zipped tarball archive.  The tarball is uncompressed and installed by either double-clicking on it or by opening a Terminal window and running the command

tar -xvf gmat-snowleopard-x86-R2011a-Alpha.tar.gz

The command extracts the GMAT system into a folder names GMAT-R2011a.  There are eight subfolders inside the main folder: bin, containing the GMAT application bundle, and startup file; data; docs; matlab; output; plugins; samples; userfunctions. 
The current Mac application (Alpha version) includes the ability to make calls to MATLAB based functions from GMAT scripts.  Calls cannot be made from MATLAB to GMAT with the current application.  

Note that when GMAT opens MATLAB, it will open X11 first (as is required for MATLAB execution).  GMAT currently does not automatically close X11 after quitting MATLAB, so the user will need to quit X11 manually.

To use MATLAB with GMAT, the user must set the MATLABFORGMAT environment variable in his/her environment.plist, located in the user's .MacOSX subdirectory.  This environment variable should point to the location of the MATLAB installation (application bundle) on the user's machine.  GMAT will not interface with MATLAB without this environment variable being set.  

To add the environment variable:

- if the environment.plist already exists in your .MacOSX directory, edit the plist using the Property List Editor to add the MATLABFORGMAT variable and set it to point to the location of your MATLAB application (e.g. /Applications/MATLAB_R2010a/MATLAB_R2010a.app)
- if you do not have an environment.plist in your .MacOSX directory, using a terminal window:
---- create the .MacOSX directory as a subdirectory in your home folder (if it does not exist)
---- open the Property List Editor, create the MATLABFORGMAT variable (it should point to your MATLAB application)
---- save the property list as environment.plist in your .MacOSX subfolder

You must logout and log back in for this to take effect.In addition, the Mac (and Linux) builds of GMAT do not yet support the interface to the fmincon optimizer.  For that reason, some of the sample missions that run on Windows - those that use optimization - will not run in the Mac build.  However, the sample missions included in this Mac distribution do run successfully, and provide an excellent introduction to using GMAT.  (Sample missions that use the VF13ad optimizer require a plugin that cannot be delivered with GMAT.  Please see GMAT's forum pages for instructions about this optimizer.)  To run the sample missions using the GUI version:1. Start GMAT by double-clicking on the icon (alternatively, you may open a terminal window, cd to the directory where the bundle exists, and type "open GMAT.app").2. Click on the yellow "Open Script" button on the toolbar. 3. Open one of the sample missions preloaded as a recent script on the Welcome Panel or one of the scripts in the "samples" folder.  "Ex_HohmannTransfer.script" is a good first choice from the samples folder.4. Press the green "Run" button on the toolbar.  The script should run, and display the output from the selected script.
