Welcome to the wonderful world of GMAT!The build files and source code can be downloaded from the GMAT website:      http://gmat.gsfc.nasa.govor from SourceForge:      http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmatIn order to build GMAT from the source, you will also need the following:- version 2.4.1 of the Apple Developer Tools (XCode 2.4.1)- wxMac version 2.8.4 (www.wxwidgets.org) - follow directions to build as a shared library with opengl and using optimization- a FORTRAN compiler In addition, an IDE such as Eclipse (with C/C++ Development Tools) is extremely helpful.  (See instructions for setting up Eclipse for Windows - it is nearly identical for the Mac).  Then follow the instructions for modifying the build files.Please note that the current Mac application (Alpha version) does not work with MATLAB.  Please feel free to contact the GMAT team for further information, to make suggestions, or for assistance with any problems you encounter building the system.  We're glad to help!- Wendy C. Shoan  GMAT Mac lead  e-mail: gmat-development@gsfc.nasa.gov
