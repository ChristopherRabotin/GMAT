/**
 * GdkDrawContext:
 *
 * Base class for objects implementing different rendering methods.

 * `GdkDrawContext` is the base object used by contexts implementing different
 * rendering methods, such as [class@Gdk.CairoContext] or [class@Gdk.GLContext].
 * It provides shared functionality between those contexts.
 *
 * You will always interact with one of those subclasses.
 *
 * A `GdkDrawContext` is always associated with a single toplevel surface.

 *
 * Calling this function begins a drawing operation using @context on the

 * guarantees for the drawing operation vary for different implementations
 * of drawing, so a [class@Gdk.CairoContext] and a [class@Gdk.GLContext]

 *
 * A call to this function is a requirement for drawing and must be
 * followed by a call to [method@Gdk.DrawContext.end_frame], which will
 * complete the drawing operation and ensure the contents become visible
 * on screen.
 *
 * Note that the @region passed to this function is the minimum region that
 * needs to be drawn and depending on implementation, windowing system and
 * hardware in use, it might be necessary to draw a larger region. Drawing
 * implementation must use [method@Gdk.DrawContext.get_frame_region] to
 * query the region that must be drawn.
 *
 * When using GTK, the widget system automatically places calls to
 * gdk_draw_context_begin_frame() and gdk_draw_context_end_frame() via the
 * use of [class@Gsk.Renderer]s, so application code does not need to call
 * these functions explicitly.

 *
 * This is only a request and if the GDK backend does not support HDR rendering
 * or does not consider it worthwhile, it may choose to not honor the request.
 * It may also choose to provide high depth even if it was not requested.
 * Typically the steps undertaken by a backend are:
 * 1. Check if high depth is supported by this drawing backend.
 * 2. Check if the compositor supports high depth.
 * 3. Check if the compositor prefers regular bit depth. This is usually the case
 *    when the attached monitors do not support high depth content or when the
 *    system is resource constrained.
 * In either of those cases, the context will usually choose to not honor the request.
 *
 * The rendering code must be able to deal with content in any bit depth, no matter
 * the preference. The prefers_high_depth argument is only a hint and GDK is free
