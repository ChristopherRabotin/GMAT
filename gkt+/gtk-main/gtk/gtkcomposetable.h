/* The layout of the data is as follows:
 *
 * The first part of the data contains rows of length max_seq_len + 1,
 * where the first element is the item of the sequence, and the
 * following elements are offsets to the data for sequences that
 * start with the first item of length 2, ..., max_seq_len.
 *
 * The second part of the data contains the rest of the sequence
 * data. It does not have a fixed stride. For each sequence, we
 * put seq[2], ..., seq[len - 1], followed by the encoded value
 * for this sequence.
 *
 * The values are encoded as follows:
 *
 * If the value is a single Unicode character smaler than 0x8000,
 * then we place it directly. Otherwise, we put the UTF8-encoded
 * value in the char_data array, and use offset | 0x8000 as the
 * encoded value.
