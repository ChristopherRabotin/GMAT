/**
 * SECTION:properties
 * @Short_description: Functions to manipulate properties on windows
 * @Title: Properties and Atoms
 *
 * Each window under X can have any number of associated
 * “properties” attached to it.
 * Properties are arbitrary chunks of data identified by
 * “atom”s. (An “atom”
 * is a numeric index into a string table on the X server. They are used
 * to transfer strings efficiently between clients without
 * having to transfer the entire string.) A property
 * has an associated type, which is also identified
 * using an atom.
 *
 * A property has an associated “format”,
 * an integer describing how many bits are in each unit
 * of data inside the property. It must be 8, 16, or 32.
 * When data is transferred between the server and client,
 * if they are of different endianesses it will be byteswapped
 * as necessary according to the format of the property.
 * Note that on the client side, properties of format 32
 * will be stored with one unit per long,
 * even if a long integer has more than 32 bits on the platform.
 * (This decision was apparently made for Xlib to maintain
 * compatibility with programs that assumed longs were 32
 * bits, at the expense of programs that knew better.)
 *
 * The functions in this section are used to add, remove
 * and change properties on windows, to convert atoms
 * to and from strings and to manipulate some types of
 * data commonly stored in X window properties.
