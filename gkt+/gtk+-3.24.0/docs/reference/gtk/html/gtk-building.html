<a name="overview"></a><h2>Building GTK+ on UNIX-like systems</h2>
<p>
      This chapter covers building and installing GTK+ on UNIX and
      UNIX-like systems such as Linux. Compiling GTK+ on Microsoft
      Windows is different in detail and somewhat more difficult to
      get going since the necessary tools aren't included with
      the operating system.
    </p>
<p>
      Before we get into the details of how to compile GTK+, we should
      mention that in many cases, binary packages of GTK+ prebuilt for
      your operating system will be available, either from your
      operating system vendor or from independent sources. If such a
      set of packages is available, installing it will get you
      programming with GTK+ much faster than building it yourself. In
      fact, you may well already have GTK+ installed on your system
      already.
    </p>
<p>
      On UNIX-like systems GTK+ uses the standard GNU build system,
      using <span class="application">autoconf</span> for package
      configuration and resolving portability issues,
      <span class="application">automake</span> for building makefiles that
      comply with the GNU Coding Standards, and
      <span class="application">libtool</span> for building shared libraries
      on multiple platforms.
    </p>
<p>
      If you are building GTK+ from the distributed source packages,
      then you won't need these tools installed; the necessary pieces
      of the tools are already included in the source packages. But
      it's useful to know a bit about how packages that use these
      tools work. A source package is distributed as a
      <code class="literal">tar.bz2</code> or <code class="literal">tar.xz</code> file
      which you unpack into a directory full of the source files as follows:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      tar xvfj gtk+-3.2.0.tar.bz2
      tar xvfJ gtk+-3.2.0.tar.xz
    </pre>
<p>
      In the toplevel directory that is created, there will be
      a shell script called <code class="filename">configure</code> which
      you then run to take the template makefiles called
      <code class="filename">Makefile.in</code> in the package and create
      makefiles customized for your operating system.
      The <code class="filename">configure</code> script can be passed
      various command line arguments to determine how the package
      is built and installed. The most commonly useful argument is
      the <code class="systemitem">--prefix</code> argument which
      determines where the package is installed. To install a package
      in <code class="filename">/opt/gtk</code> you would run configure as:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/gtk
    </pre>
<p>
      A full list of options can be found by running
      <code class="filename">configure</code> with the
      <code class="systemitem">--help</code> argument. In general, the defaults are
      right and should be trusted. After you've run
      <code class="filename">configure</code>, you then run the
      <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span> command to build the package and install
      it.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      make
      make install
    </pre>
<p>
      If you don't have permission to write to the directory you are
      installing in, you may have to change to root temporarily before
      running <code class="literal">make install</code>. Also, if you are
      installing in a system directory, on some systems (such as
      Linux), you will need to run <span class="command"><strong>ldconfig</strong></span> after
      <code class="literal">make install</code> so that the newly installed
      libraries will be found.
    </p>
<p>
      Several environment variables are useful to pass to set before
      running configure. <code class="envar">CPPFLAGS</code> contains options to
      pass to the C compiler, and is used to tell the compiler where
      to look for include files. The <code class="envar">LDFLAGS</code> variable
      is used in a similar fashion for the linker. Finally the
      <code class="envar">PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> environment variable contains
      a search path that <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span> (see below)
      uses when looking for files describing how to compile
      programs using different libraries. If you were installing GTK+
      and it's dependencies into <code class="filename">/opt/gtk</code>, you
      might want to set these variables as:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/gtk/include"
      LDFLAGS="-L/opt/gtk/lib"
      PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/gtk/lib/pkgconfig"
      export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    </pre>
<p>
      You may also need to set the <code class="envar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
      environment variable so the systems dynamic linker can find
      the newly installed libraries, and the <code class="envar">PATH</code>
      environment program so that utility binaries installed by
      the various libraries will be found.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/gtk/lib"
      PATH="/opt/gtk/bin:$PATH"
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH PATH
    </pre>

      Before you can compile the GTK+ widget toolkit, you need to have
      various other tools and libraries installed on your
      system. The two tools needed during the build process (as
      differentiated from the tools used in when creating GTK+
      mentioned above such as <span class="application">autoconf</span>)
      are <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span> and GNU make.

          libraries that are used by the GTK+ libraries. (For each

          in a standard location that contains the compilation flags

          installing <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make" target="_top">GNU

<p>
      First make sure that you have the necessary external
      dependencies installed: <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span>, GNU make,
      the JPEG, PNG, and TIFF libraries, FreeType, and, if necessary,
      libiconv and libintl. To get detailed information about building
      these packages, see the documentation provided with the
      individual packages.
      On a Linux system, it's quite likely you'll have all of these
      installed already except for <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span>.
    </p>
<p>
      Then build and install the GTK+ libraries in the order:
      GLib, Pango, ATK, then GTK+. For each library, follow the
      steps of <code class="literal">configure</code>, <code class="literal">make</code>,
      <code class="literal">make install</code> mentioned above. If you're
      lucky, this will all go smoothly, and you'll be ready to
      <a class="link" href="gtk-compiling.html" title="Compiling GTK+ Applications">start compiling your own GTK+
      applications</a>. You can test your GTK+ installation
      by running the <span class="command"><strong>gtk3-demo</strong></span> program that
      GTK+ installs.
    </p>
<p>
      If one of the <code class="filename">configure</code> scripts fails or running
      <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span> fails, look closely at the error
      messages printed; these will often provide useful information
      as to what went wrong. When <code class="filename">configure</code>
      fails, extra information, such as errors that a test compilation
      ran into, is found in the file <code class="filename">config.log</code>.
      Looking at the last couple of hundred lines in this file will
      frequently make clear what went wrong. If all else fails, you
      can ask for help on the gtk-list mailing list.

<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-modules</code> and
          <code class="systemitem">--enable-modules</code>. </b>
          Normally GTK+ will try to build the input method modules
          as little shared libraries that are loaded on demand.
          The <code class="systemitem">--disable-modules</code> argument
          indicates that they should all be built statically
          into the GTK+ library instead. This is useful for
          people who need to produce statically-linked binaries.
          If neither <code class="systemitem">--disable-modules</code> nor
          <code class="systemitem">--enable-modules</code> is specified,
          then the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script will try to
          auto-detect whether shared modules work on your system.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--with-included-immodules</code>. </b>
         This option allows you to specify which input method modules you
         want to include directly into the GTK+ shared library, as opposed
         to building them as loadable modules.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--enable-debug</code>. </b>
         Turns on various amounts of debugging support. Setting this to
         'no' disables g_assert(), g_return_if_fail(), g_return_val_if_fail()           and all cast checks between different object types. Setting it
         to 'minimum' disables only cast checks. Setting it to 'yes' enables
         <a class="link" href="gtk-running.html#GTK-Debug-Options" title="GTK_DEBUG">runtime debugging</a>.
         The default is 'minimum'.
         Note that 'no' is fast, but dangerous as it tends to destabilize
         even mostly bug-free software by changing the effect of many bugs
         from simple warnings into fatal crashes. Thus
         <code class="option">--enable-debug=no</code> should <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
         be used for stable releases of GTK+.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-Bsymbolic</code> and
          <code class="systemitem">--enable-Bsymbolic</code>. </b>
          The option <code class="systemitem">--disable-Bsymbolic</code>
          turns off the use of the -Bsymbolic-functions linker flag.
          This is only necessary if you want to override GTK+ functions
          by using <code class="envar">LD_PRELOAD</code>.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--enable-explicit-deps</code> and
          <code class="systemitem">--disable-explicit-deps</code>. </b>
          If <code class="systemitem">--enable-explicit-deps</code> is
          specified then GTK+ will write the full set of libraries
          that GTK+ depends upon into its <code class="literal">.pc</code> files to be used when
          programs depending on GTK+ are linked. Otherwise, GTK+
          only will include the GTK+ libraries themselves, and
          will depend on system library dependency facilities to
          bring in the other libraries.
          By default GTK+ will disable explicit dependencies unless
          it detects that they are needed on the system. (If you
          specify <code class="systemitem">--enable-static</code> to force
          building of static libraries, then explicit dependencies
          will be written since library dependencies don't work
          for static libraries.) Specifying
          <code class="systemitem">--enable-explicit-deps</code> or
          <code class="systemitem">--enable-static</code> can cause
          compatibility
          problems when libraries that GTK+ depends upon change
          their versions, and should be avoided if possible.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-xkb</code> and
          <code class="systemitem">--enable-xkb</code>. </b>
          By default the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script will try
          to auto-detect whether the XKB extension is supported by
          the X libraries GTK+ is linked with.
          These options can be used to explicitly control whether
          GTK+ will support the XKB extension.

<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-xinerama</code> and
          <code class="systemitem">--enable-xinerama</code>. </b>
          By default the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script will try
          to link against the Xinerama libraries if they are found.
          These options can be used to explicitly control whether
          Xinerama should be used.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-xinput</code> and
           <code class="systemitem">--enable-xinput</code>. </b>
          Controls whether GTK+ is built with support for the XInput
          or XInput2 extension. These extensions provide an extended
          interface to input devices such as graphics tablets.
          When this support is compiled in, specially written
          GTK+ programs can get access to subpixel positions,
          multiple simultaneous input devices, and extra "axes"
          provided by the device such as pressure and tilt
          information.

          <code class="systemitem">--enable-gtk-doc</code>. </b>
          The <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> package is
          used to generate the reference documentation included
          with GTK+. By default support for <span class="application">gtk-doc</span>
          is disabled because it requires various extra dependencies
          to be installed. If you have
          <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> installed and
          are modifying GTK+, you may want to enable
          <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> support by passing
          in <code class="systemitem">--enable-gtk-doc</code>. If not
          enabled, pre-generated HTML files distributed with GTK+
          will be installed.

<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-cups</code> and

          By default the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script will try
          to build the cups print backend if the cups libraries are found.
          These options can be used to explicitly control whether
          the cups print backend should be built.

          By default the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script will try
          to build the papi print backend if the papi libraries are found.
          These options can be used to explicitly control whether

          By default the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script will try
          to build the PackageKit support for the open-with dialog if
          the PackageKit libraries are found.
          These options can be used to explicitly control whether
          PackageKit support should be built.

          Enables specific backends for GDK.  If none of these options
          are given, the x11 backend will be enabled by default,
          unless the platform is Windows, in which case the default is
          win32.  If any backend is explicitly enabled or disabled, no
          other platform will be enabled automatically.  Other
          supported backends are the quartz backend for OS X.

          Metadata for the tests is installed in <code class="filename">${prefix}/share/installed-tests/gtk+</code>.
          To run the installed tests, gnome-desktop-testing-runner
