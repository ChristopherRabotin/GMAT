<a name="input-overview"></a><h2>Overview of GTK+ input and event handling</h2>
<p>
   This chapter describes in detail how GTK+ handles input. If you are interested
   in what happens to translate a key press or mouse motion of the users into a
   change of a GTK+ widget, you should read this chapter. This knowledge will also
   be useful if you decide to implement your own widgets.
  </p>
<div class="refsect2">
<a name="id-1.2.7.3.3"></a><h3>Devices and events</h3>
<p>
     The most basic input devices that every computer user has interacted with are
     keyboards and mice; beyond these, GTK+ supports touchpads, touchscreens and
     more exotic input devices such as graphics tablets. Inside GTK+, every such
     input device is represented by a <a href="../html/GdkDevice.html#GdkDevice-struct"><span class="type">GdkDevice</span></a> object.
    </p>
<p>
     To simplify dealing with the variability between these input devices, GTK+
     has a concept of master and slave devices. The concrete physical devices that
     have many different characteristics (mice may have 2 or 3 or 8 buttons,
     keyboards have different layouts and may or may not have a separate number
     block, etc) are represented as slave devices. Each slave device is
     associated with a virtual master device. Master devices always come in
     pointer/keyboard pairs - you can think of such a pair as a 'seat'.
    </p>
<p>
     GTK+ widgets generally deal with the master devices, and thus can be used
     with any pointing device or keyboard.
    </p>
<p>
     When a user interacts with an input device (e.g. moves a mouse or presses
     a key on the keyboard), GTK+ receives events from the windowing system.
     These are typically directed at a specific window - for pointer events,
     the window under the pointer (grabs complicate this), for keyboard events,
     the window with the keyboard focus.
    </p>
<p>
     GDK translates these raw windowing system events into <a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEvent"><span class="type">GdkEvents</span></a>.
     Typical input events are:
     </p>
<table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist">
<tr><td><a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventButton"><span class="type">GdkEventButton</span></a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventMotion"><span class="type">GdkEventMotion</span></a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventCrossing"><span class="type">GdkEventCrossing</span></a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventKey"><span class="type">GdkEventKey</span></a></td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventTouch"><span class="type">GdkEventTouch</span></a></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
    </p>
<p>
      Additionally, GDK/GTK synthesizes other signals to let know whether
      grabs (system-wide or in-app) are taking input away:
      </p>
<table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist">
<tr><td><a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventGrabBroken"><span class="type">GdkEventGrabBroken</span></a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-grab-notify" title="The “grab-notify” signal"><span class="type">“grab-notify”</span></a></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
    </p>
<p>
      When GTK+ is initialized, it sets up an event handler function with
      <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#gdk-event-handler-set"><code class="function">gdk_event_handler_set()</code></a>, which receives all of these input events
      (as well as others, for instance window management related events).
    </p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="refsect2">
<a name="event-propagation"></a><h3>Event propagation</h3>
<p>
      For widgets which have a <a href="../html/gdk3-Windows.html#GdkWindow-struct"><span class="type">GdkWindow</span></a> set, events are received from the
      windowing system and passed to <a class="link" href="gtk3-General.html#gtk-main-do-event" title="gtk_main_do_event ()"><code class="function">gtk_main_do_event()</code></a>. See its documentation
      for details of what it does: compression of enter/leave events,
      identification of the widget receiving the event, pushing the event onto a
      stack for <a class="link" href="gtk3-General.html#gtk-get-current-event" title="gtk_get_current_event ()"><code class="function">gtk_get_current_event()</code></a>, and propagating the event to the
      widget.
    </p>
<p>
      When a GDK backend produces an input event, it is tied to a <a href="../html/GdkDevice.html#GdkDevice-struct"><span class="type">GdkDevice</span></a> and
      a <a href="../html/gdk3-Windows.html#GdkWindow-struct"><span class="type">GdkWindow</span></a>, which in turn represents a windowing system surface in the
      backend. If a widget has grabbed the current input device, or all input
      devices, the event is propagated to that <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html" title="GtkWidget"><span class="type">GtkWidget</span></a>. Otherwise, it is
      propagated to the the <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html" title="GtkWidget"><span class="type">GtkWidget</span></a> which called <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-register-window" title="gtk_widget_register_window ()"><code class="function">gtk_widget_register_window()</code></a>
      on the <a href="../html/gdk3-Windows.html#GdkWindow-struct"><span class="type">GdkWindow</span></a> receiving the event.
    </p>
<p>
      Grabs are implemented for each input device, and globally. A grab for a
      specific input device (<a class="link" href="gtk3-General.html#gtk-device-grab-add" title="gtk_device_grab_add ()"><code class="function">gtk_device_grab_add()</code></a>), is sent events in
      preference to a global grab (<a class="link" href="gtk3-General.html#gtk-grab-add" title="gtk_grab_add ()"><code class="function">gtk_grab_add()</code></a>). Input grabs only have effect
      within the <a class="link" href="GtkWindowGroup.html" title="GtkWindowGroup"><span class="type">GtkWindowGroup</span></a> containing the <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html" title="GtkWidget"><span class="type">GtkWidget</span></a> which registered the
      event’s <a href="../html/gdk3-Windows.html#GdkWindow-struct"><span class="type">GdkWindow</span></a>. If this <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html" title="GtkWidget"><span class="type">GtkWidget</span></a> is a child of the grab widget, the
      event is propagated to the child — this is the basis for propagating
      events within modal dialogs.
    </p>
<p>
      An event is propagated to a widget using <a class="link" href="gtk3-General.html#gtk-propagate-event" title="gtk_propagate_event ()"><code class="function">gtk_propagate_event()</code></a>.
      Propagation differs between event types: key events (<a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-KEY-PRESS:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_KEY_PRESS</code></a>,
      <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-KEY-RELEASE:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_KEY_RELEASE</code></a>) are delivered to the top-level <a class="link" href="GtkWindow.html" title="GtkWindow"><span class="type">GtkWindow</span></a>; other events
      are propagated down and up the widget hierarchy in three phases (see
      <a class="link" href="GtkEventController.html#GtkPropagationPhase" title="enum GtkPropagationPhase"><span class="type">GtkPropagationPhase</span></a>).
    </p>
<p>
      For key events, the top-level window’s default <span class="type">“key-press-event”</span>
      and <span class="type">“key-release-event”</span> signal handlers handle mnemonics and
      accelerators first. Other key presses are then passed to
      <a class="link" href="GtkWindow.html#gtk-window-propagate-key-event" title="gtk_window_propagate_key_event ()"><code class="function">gtk_window_propagate_key_event()</code></a> which propagates the event upwards from
      the window’s current focus widget (<a class="link" href="GtkWindow.html#gtk-window-get-focus" title="gtk_window_get_focus ()"><code class="function">gtk_window_get_focus()</code></a>) to the
      top-level.
    </p>
<p>
      For other events, in the first phase (the “capture” phase) the event is
      delivered to each widget from the top-most (for example, the top-level
      <a class="link" href="GtkWindow.html" title="GtkWindow"><span class="type">GtkWindow</span></a> or grab widget) down to the target <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html" title="GtkWidget"><span class="type">GtkWidget</span></a>.
      <a class="link" href="chap-input-handling.html#event-controllers-and-gestures" title="Event controllers and gestures">Gestures</a> that are
      attached with <a class="link" href="GtkEventController.html#GTK-PHASE-CAPTURE:CAPS"><code class="literal">GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE</code></a> get a chance to react to the event.
    </p>
<p>
      After the “capture” phase, the widget that was intended to be the
      destination of the event will run gestures attached to it with
      <a class="link" href="GtkEventController.html#GTK-PHASE-TARGET:CAPS"><code class="literal">GTK_PHASE_TARGET</code></a>. This is known as the “target” phase, and only
      happens on that widget.
    </p>
<p>
      Next, the <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-event" title="The “event” signal"><span class="type">“event”</span></a> signal is emitted, then the appropriate signal
      for the event in question, for example <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-motion-notify-event" title="The “motion-notify-event” signal"><span class="type">“motion-notify-event”</span></a>.
      Handling these signals was the primary way to handle input in GTK+ widgets
      before gestures were introduced. If the widget is realized, the
      <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-event-after" title="The “event-after” signal"><span class="type">“event-after”</span></a> signal is emitted. The signals are emitted from
      the target widget up to the top-level, as part of the “bubble” phase.
    </p>
<p>
      The default handlers for the event signals send the event
      to gestures that are attached with <a class="link" href="GtkEventController.html#GTK-PHASE-BUBBLE:CAPS"><code class="literal">GTK_PHASE_BUBBLE</code></a>. Therefore,
      gestures in the “bubble” phase are only used if the widget does
      not have its own event handlers, or takes care to chain up to the
      default <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html" title="GtkWidget"><span class="type">GtkWidget</span></a> handlers.
    </p>
<p>
      Events are not delivered to a widget which is insensitive or unmapped.
    </p>
<p>
      Any time during the propagation phase, a widget may indicate that a
      received event was consumed and propagation should therefore be stopped.
      In traditional event handlers, this is hinted by returning <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-EVENT-STOP:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_EVENT_STOP</code></a>.
      If gestures are used, this may happen when the widget tells the gesture
      to claim the event touch sequence (or the pointer events) for its own. See the
      "gesture states" section below to know more of the latter.
    </p>

<hr>
<div class="refsect2">
<a name="event-masks"></a><h3>Event masks</h3>
<p>
      Each widget instance has a basic event mask and another per input device,
      which determine the types of input event it receives. Each event mask set
      on a widget is added to the corresponding (basic or per-device) event mask
      for the widget’s <a href="../html/gdk3-Windows.html#GdkWindow-struct"><span class="type">GdkWindow</span></a>, and all child <a href="../html/gdk3-Windows.html#GdkWindow-struct"><span class="type">GdkWindows</span></a>.
    </p>
<p>
      If a widget is windowless (<a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-get-has-window" title="gtk_widget_get_has_window ()"><code class="function">gtk_widget_get_has_window()</code></a> returns <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/unstable/glib-Standard-Macros.html#FALSE:CAPS"><code class="literal">FALSE</code></a>) and
      an application wants to receive custom events on it, it must be placed
      inside a <a class="link" href="GtkEventBox.html" title="GtkEventBox"><span class="type">GtkEventBox</span></a> to receive the events, and an appropriate event mask
      must be set on the box. When implementing a widget, use a <a href="../html/gdk3-Windows.html#GDK-INPUT-ONLY:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_INPUT_ONLY</code></a>
      <a href="../html/gdk3-Windows.html#GdkWindow-struct"><span class="type">GdkWindow</span></a> to receive the events instead.
    </p>
<p>
      Filtering events against event masks happens inside <a href="../html/gdk3-Windows.html#GdkWindow-struct"><span class="type">GdkWindow</span></a>, which
      exposes event masks to the windowing system to reduce the number of events
      GDK receives from it. On receiving an event, it is filtered against the
      <a href="../html/gdk3-Windows.html#GdkWindow-struct"><span class="type">GdkWindow</span></a>’s mask for the input device, if set. Otherwise, it is filtered
      against the <a href="../html/gdk3-Windows.html#GdkWindow-struct"><span class="type">GdkWindow</span></a>’s basic event mask.
    </p>
<p>
      This means that widgets must add to the event mask for each event type
      they expect to receive, using <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-set-events" title="gtk_widget_set_events ()"><code class="function">gtk_widget_set_events()</code></a> or
      <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-add-events" title="gtk_widget_add_events ()"><code class="function">gtk_widget_add_events()</code></a> to preserve the existing mask. Widgets which are
      aware of floating devices should use <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-set-device-events" title="gtk_widget_set_device_events ()"><code class="function">gtk_widget_set_device_events()</code></a> or
      <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-add-device-events" title="gtk_widget_add_device_events ()"><code class="function">gtk_widget_add_device_events()</code></a>, and must explicitly enable the device
      using <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-set-device-enabled" title="gtk_widget_set_device_enabled ()"><code class="function">gtk_widget_set_device_enabled()</code></a>. See the <a href="../html/GdkDeviceManager.html#GdkDeviceManager-struct"><span class="type">GdkDeviceManager</span></a>
      documentation for more information.
    </p>
<p>
      All standard widgets set the event mask for all events they expect to
      receive, and it is not necessary to modify this. Masks should be set when
      implementing a new widget.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="refsect2">
<a name="id-1.2.7.3.6"></a><h3>Touch events</h3>
<p>
      Touch events are emitted as events of type <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-TOUCH-BEGIN:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN</code></a>, <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-TOUCH-UPDATE:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_UPDATE</code></a> or
      <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-TOUCH-END:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_END</code></a>, those events contain an “event sequence” that univocally identifies
      the physical touch until it is lifted from the device.
    </p>
<p>
      On some windowing platforms, multitouch devices perform pointer emulation, this works
      by granting a “pointer emulating” hint to one of the currently interacting touch
      sequences, which will be reported on every <a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventTouch"><span class="type">GdkEventTouch</span></a> event from that sequence. By
      default, if a widget didn't request touch events by setting <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-TOUCH-MASK:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_MASK</code></a> on its
      event mask and didn't override <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-touch-event" title="The “touch-event” signal"><span class="type">“touch-event”</span></a>, GTK+ will transform these
      “pointer emulating” events into semantically similar <a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventButton"><span class="type">GdkEventButton</span></a> and <a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventMotion"><span class="type">GdkEventMotion</span></a>
      events. Depending on <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-TOUCH-MASK:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_MASK</code></a> being in the event mask or not, non-pointer-emulating
      sequences could still trigger gestures or just get filtered out, regardless of the widget
      not handling those directly.
    </p>
<p>
      If the widget sets <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-TOUCH-MASK:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_MASK</code></a> on its event mask and doesn't chain up on
      <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-touch-event" title="The “touch-event” signal"><span class="type">“touch-event”</span></a>, only touch events will be received, and no pointer emulation
      will be performed.
    </p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="refsect2">
<a name="id-1.2.7.3.7"></a><h3>Grabs</h3>
<p>
      Grabs are a method to claim all input events from a device, they happen
      either implicitly on pointer and touch devices, or explicitly. Implicit grabs
      happen on user interaction, when a <span class="type">GdkEventButtonPress</span> happens, all events from
      then on, until after the corresponding <span class="type">GdkEventButtonRelease</span>, will be reported
      to the widget that got the first event. Likewise, on touch events, every
      <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GdkEventSequence"><span class="type">GdkEventSequence</span></a> will deliver only events to the widget that received its
      <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-TOUCH-BEGIN:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN</code></a> event.
    </p>
<p>
      Explicit grabs happen programatically (both activation and deactivation),
      and can be either system-wide (GDK grabs) or application-wide (GTK grabs).
      On the windowing platforms that support it, GDK grabs will prevent any
      interaction with any other application/window/widget than the grabbing one,
      whereas GTK grabs will be effective only within the application (across all
      its windows), still allowing for interaction with other applications.
    </p>
<p>
      But one important aspect of grabs is that they may potentially happen at any
      point somewhere else, even while the pointer/touch device is already grabbed.
      This makes it necessary for widgets to handle the cancellation of any ongoing
      interaction. Depending on whether a GTK or GDK grab is causing this, the
      widget will respectively receive a <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-grab-notify" title="The “grab-notify” signal"><span class="type">“grab-notify”</span></a> signal, or a
      <a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventGrabBroken"><span class="type">GdkEventGrabBroken</span></a> event.
    </p>
<p>
      On gestures, these signals are handled automatically, causing the gesture
      to cancel all tracked pointer/touch events, and signal the end of recognition.
    </p>

<div class="refsect2">
<a name="id-1.2.7.3.8"></a><h3>Keyboard input</h3>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="refsect2">
<a name="event-controllers-and-gestures"></a><h3>Event controllers and gestures</h3>
<p>
      Event controllers are standalone objects that can perform specific actions
      upon received <a href="../html/gdk3-Event-Structures.html#GdkEvent"><span class="type">GdkEvents</span></a>. These are tied to a <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html" title="GtkWidget"><span class="type">GtkWidget</span></a>, and can be told of
      the event propagation phase at which they will manage the events.
    </p>
<p>
      Gestures are a set of specific controllers that are prepared to handle pointer
      and/or touch events, each gestures implementation attempts to recognize specific
      actions out the received events, notifying of the state/progress accordingly to
      let the widget react to those. On multi-touch gestures, every interacting touch
      sequence will be tracked independently.
    </p>
<p>
      Being gestures “simple” units, it is not uncommon to tie several together to
      perform higher level actions, grouped gestures handle the same event sequences
      simultaneously, and those sequences share a same state across all grouped
      gestures. Some examples of grouping may be:

      </p>
<table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist">
<tr><td>
	  A “drag” and a “swipe” gestures may want grouping. The former will report
	  events as the dragging happens, the latter will tell the swipe X/Y velocities
	  only after gesture has finished.
	</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	  Grouping a “drag” gesture with a “pan” gesture will only effectively allow
	  dragging in the panning orientation, as both gestures share state.
	</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	  If “press” and “long press” are wanted simultaneously, those would need grouping.
	</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
    </p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="refsect2">
<a name="id-1.2.7.3.10"></a><h3>Gesture states</h3>
<p>
      Gestures have a notion of “state” for each individual touch sequence. When events
      from a touch sequence are first received, the touch sequence will have “none” state,
      this means the touch sequence is being handled by the gesture to possibly trigger
      actions, but the event propagation will not be stopped.
    </p>
<p>
      When the gesture enters recognition, or at a later point in time, the widget may
      choose to claim the touch sequences (individually or as a group), hence stopping
      event propagation after the event is run through every gesture in that widget and
      propagation phase. Anytime this happens, the touch sequences are cancelled downwards
      the propagation chain, to let these know that no further events will be sent.
    </p>
<p>
      Alternatively, or at a later point in time, the widget may choose to deny the touch
      sequences, thus letting those go through again in event propagation. When this happens
      in the capture phase, and if there are no other claiming gestures in the widget,
      a <a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-TOUCH-BEGIN:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN</code></a>/<a href="../html/gdk3-Events.html#GDK-BUTTON-PRESS:CAPS"><code class="literal">GDK_BUTTON_PRESS</code></a> event will be emulated and
      propagated downwards, in order to preserve consistency.
    </p>
<p>
      Grouped gestures always share the same state for a given touch sequence, so setting
      the state on one does transfer the state to the others. They also are mutually exclusive,
      within a widget there may be only one gesture group claiming a given sequence. If
      another gesture group claims later that same sequence, the first group will deny the
