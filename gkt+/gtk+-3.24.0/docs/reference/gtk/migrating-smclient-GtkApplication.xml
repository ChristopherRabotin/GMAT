  <title>Migrating from EggSMClient to GtkApplication</title>

  <para>
    EggSMClient provides 'session management' support for applications.
    This means a number of things:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>logout notification and negotiation</listitem>
      <listitem>application state saving</listitem>
      <listitem>restarting of applications with saved state</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    EggSMClient supports this functionality to varying degrees on
    Windows and OS X, as well as with XSMP and D-Bus based session
    managers in X11.
  </para>

  <para>
    Starting with GTK+ 3.4, #GtkApplication supports logout notification
    and negotiation similar to EggSMClient.

  <para>
    At this point, GtkApplication has no special support for state saving
    and restarting. Applications can use GSettings or GKeyFile and save as
    much state as they see fit in response to #GApplication::shutdown or
    whenever they consider appropriate.
