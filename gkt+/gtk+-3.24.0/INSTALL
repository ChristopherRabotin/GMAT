Prerequisites
=============

GTK+ requires the following packages:

 - The GLib, Pango, GdkPixbuf, ATK and cairo libraries, available at
   the same location as GTK+. GTK+ 3.24.0 requires at least
   GLib 2.49.4, Pango 1.41.0,
   GdkPixbuf 2.30.0, ATK 2.15.1
   and cairo 1.14.0.

 - libepoxy, for cross-platform OpenGL support.
   It can be found here: https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy

 - Each GDK backend has its own backend-specific requirements. For
   the X11 backend, X11 R6 and XInput version 2 (as well as a number
   of other extensions) are required. The Wayland backend requires
   (obviously) the Wayland libraries.

 - gobject-introspection 1.39.0 or newer.

Simple install procedure
========================

  % tar xf gtk+-3.24.0.tar.xz          # unpack the sources
  % cd gtk+-3.24.0                     # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                        # run the `configure' script
  % make                               # build GTK+
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install                       # install GTK+
