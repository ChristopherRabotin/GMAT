accessibility-dump is a test runner that can do tests of static
accessibility information. Run it like this:

./accessibility-dump [OPTIONS] TESTFILE [TESTFILES...]

where TESTFILE is a GtkBuilder .ui file. accessibility-dump creates
a textual dump of the accessibility information for the created
widget hierarchy and compares it to a preexisting .txt file.

To create an initial dump, you can use the --generate option with
a single .ui file. You should carefully inspect the output before
blessing it as the official .txt to compare against.

To find out details about a failure, you can use the --verbose
option to see differences between expected and actual output.

When run without any arguments, all the .ui files in the current
directory are tested.
