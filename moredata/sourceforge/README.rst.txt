    want. Just download, run, and follow the instructions.

    GMAT for Windows, bundled into a .zip file. This package 
    includes the complete GMAT release, but does not 
    include an installer to set up Start Menu items, associate
    file types, etc. Just unzip the file and run the
    ``bin\GMAT.exe`` file to start.

* ``gmat-src-R2014a.zip``

    Source code for GMAT R2014a. If you want to run GMAT on
    Linux or Mac, you must build it from source code, using
    either this package, or by checking out the ``R2014a``
    branch from our repository:
	
	``git clone -b R2014a git://git.code.sf.net/p/gmat/git gmat-git``
    
* ``gmat-datafiles-R2014a.zip``
