This directory contains extra files that may be useful for working with GMAT.
Below is a description of the files:

notepad++.xml
-------------
This is a syntax file for the Notepad++ text editor for Windows
(http://notepad-plus-plus.org/). To use it, open Notepad++ and on the Language menu,
click "Define Your Language". Click Import and open the notepad++.xml file.

Notepad++ will now detect GMAT scripts with .script and .gmf extensions, and you
can set the syntax manually through the Language menu.
