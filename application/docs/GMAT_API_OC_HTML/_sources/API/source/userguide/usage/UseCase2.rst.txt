Example: MONTE-GMAT Interoperability for OSIRIS_REx
***************************************************
At this writing, the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, 
Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft is in orbit at the near-Earth 
asteroid Bennu (formerly 1999 RQ36). The mission plans to bring at least a 
2.1-ounce sample of the asteroid back to Earth for study. The mission is using 
the Mission Analysis, Operations and Navigation Toolkit Environment, 
`MONTE <https://montepy.jpl.nasa.gov/>`_, for navigation and trajectory 
planning.

In this example, data will be shared between MONTE and GMAT using interfaces 
built with MONTE's native Python framework and GMAT's API, accessed through 
Python.

Ephemeris Sharing
=================
Both GMAT and MONTE have ephemeris reading and writing capabilities.  GMAT 
supports four types of spacecraft ephemerides: Goddard specific "Code-500", STK
time-position-velocity (.e), CCSDS OEM, and SPICE SPK formats.  MONTE supports 
SPICE based SPK ephemerides, so that format is used for data interchange between
the systems.

General Ephemeris Sharing
-------------------------
Ephemeris sharing between GMAT and MONTE is straightforward: use the system 
providing the ephemeris to generate the file, and then import it into the other
system.  The steps for this procedure are described below, beginning with the
GMAT to MONTE procedure.

:ref:`UseCase1` describes the steps needed to propagate a spacecraft using the 
GMAT API.  The sample code shown here starts from a similar propagation 
configuration, with a spacecraft in the following initial state:
