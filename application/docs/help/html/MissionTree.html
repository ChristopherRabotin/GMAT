  script command mission sequence (everything after the
  <span class="guilabel">BeginMissionSequence</span> in your script). It represents the
  ordered list of commands to be executed to model your mission. The
  hierarchical grouping in the mission tree represent commands that are
  executed inside a control logic command, e.g., <span class="guilabel">If</span>,
  <span class="guilabel">For</span>, <span class="guilabel">While</span>, etc. The mission tree
  allows you to add, edit, delete and rename commands. It allows you to
  configure or filter the display of the commands in the Mission Tree to make
  the command execution easier to understand or modify. An example Mission
  Tree screenshot is below. The Mission Tree window is made up of 2 elements:
  the Mission Sequence on the left and the view filters toolbar on the
  right.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="../files/images/Using_MissionTree_GUI_1.png" align="middle" height="375"></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>Edits to the Mission Tree will be reflected in your script after it
    is synchronized and vice-versa. If you edit the Mission Tree, you need to
    synchronize with the script to see it in the script editor. If you edit
    the script, you need to synchronize with the GUI to see your changes
    reflected in the Mission Tree.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N106DB"></a>Mission Tree Display</h3></div></div></div><p>The Mission Tree Display shows your hierarchical, ordered list of
    commands. Normally, the Mission Tree displays only the command name in the
    tree for each command node (more information such as command type,
    construction information, etc can be displayed using the <span class="guilabel">Show
    Detail</span> menu option). Commands are executed in the order they
    appear, e.g., GMAT executes commands from the top of the Mission Tree to
    the bottom. For control logic (<span class="guilabel">If</span>,
    <span class="guilabel">For</span>, and <span class="guilabel">While</span>) and the
    <span class="guilabel">Optimize</span> and <span class="guilabel">Target</span> commands,
    you can define a block of commands that execute as children of the parent
    command. These child commands of the control logic or the
    <span class="guilabel">Optimize</span> and <span class="guilabel">Target</span> commands
    appear indented. Use the plus (<span class="guilabel">+</span>) symbol to the left
    of the control logic command to show all the grouped commands and the
    minus (<span class="guilabel">-</span>) symbol to hide all the grouped commands.
    Commands that are grouped under control logic commands (e.g.
    <span class="guilabel">If</span>, <span class="guilabel">For</span>, and
    <span class="guilabel">While</span>) only execute if that control logic command is
    successfully executed (e.g., if the local expression evaluates to true for
    <span class="guilabel">If</span> command, or the loop condition evaluates to true
    for <span class="guilabel">For</span> and <span class="guilabel">While</span>
    commands).</p><p>In general, commands are executed only once. However, child commands
    grouped under the loop commands (e.g. <span class="guilabel">For</span> and
    <span class="guilabel">While</span>) may execute multiple times. These commands
    will execute for each time the loop command evaluates to true. Commands
    under the <span class="guilabel">If</span> commands are only executed if the
    <span class="guilabel">If</span> condition evaluates to true; otherwise, they are
    skipped. For the <span class="guilabel">If-Else</span> command, child commands
    grouped under the <span class="guilabel">If</span> portion of the command execute
    if the conditional statement evaluates to true; otherwise, the child
    commands grouped under the <span class="guilabel">Else</span> portion of the
    command execute.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Note that all commands in the Mission Tree are grouped under a
      special <span class="guilabel">Mission Sequence</span> home item. This home item
      is always present as the first item in the Mission Tree and cannot be
      deleted.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N1072D"></a>View Filters Toolbar</h3></div></div></div><p>The Mission Tree may display a subset of the commands of the full
    mission sequence based on your view filter options. There are 3 basic
    filtering options available within GMAT:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Filter by branch level</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Filter by command types (inclusive)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Filter by command types (exclusive)</p></li></ul></div><p>The view filters activate by clicking one of the view filter buttons
    to the right of the Mission Tree. The pressed (pushed in) button indicates
    which filter is currently enabled. The four buttons on the top are the
    Filter by branch level buttons. The next four buttons in the middle are
    the inclusive filter-by-command-types buttons, and the four buttons on the
    bottom are the exclusive filter-by-command-types buttons. The button at
    the very bottom of the view filters toolbar allows you to define a custom
    filter. You cannot combine filter-by-branch-level filters with the
    filter-by-command-type filters nor combine inclusive and exclusive command
    type filters. However, multiple inclusive command type filters can be
    combined (e.g., filter both physics related and solver related commands)
    or multiple exclusive command type filters can be combined.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Note that all parents of a viewable command are displayed, even if
      the parent command is not part of the viewable command set.</p><p>Also note that the Mission Tree automatically reconfigures to show

      command type. You may select to only display commands that are in a
      filter command type set (inclusive) or only display commands that are
      not in a filter command type set (exclusive). GMAT provides both
      pre-configured command type sets (e.g., physics related or output
      related) and custom command type sets that you define</p><p>The four middle buttons in the View Options toolbar are
      pre-configured inclusive command filters, e.g., only display commands
      that are in the desired command set. The four inclusive filter buttons
      correspond to (from top to bottom):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Physics Related (<span class="guilabel">Propagate</span>,

      example, to filter both physics related and solver related commands,
      click both the physics-related and solver-related filter buttons so that
      they appear pressed down. This option will show all physics related and

        level up) as the parent command. The <span class="guimenuitem">Insert
