      completeness since the <span class="guilabel">Antenna</span> resource may have a
      function in a future GMAT release. Finally, we set the transmitter
      frequency in the last GMAT script line above. See the
      <span class="guilabel">RunEstimator</span> Help for a complete description of how
      this input frequency is used. As described in the Help, since in this
      example we will be using a ramp table, this input frequency will not be
      used to calculate the computed value of the range and Doppler
      observations. Instead, the frequency value in the ramp table will be
      used to calculate the computed range and Doppler observations.</p><p>There is one clarification to the statement above. As discussed in
