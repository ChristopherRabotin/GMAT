    a file containing measurement data stored in GMAT&rsquo;s internal format. There
    are 4 lines of data representing range data at two successive times and
    Doppler data at two successive times. As we expected, we have no more than
    4 total measurements. Refer to the <span class="guilabel">TrackingFileSet</span>
    Help for a description of the range and Doppler GMD file format.</p><p>We now analyze the first line of data which represents a DSN two way
    range measurement at the start of the simulation at '19 Aug 2015

    of 27253.500405092593 TAIMJD.</p><p>The second and third fields, DSN_SeqRange and 9004, are just
    internal GMAT codes indicating the use of DSN range (Trk 2-34 type 7)
    data.</p><p>The 4th field, 22222, is the Downlink station ID. This is the ID we
    gave the <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> <span class="guilabel">GroundStation</span>
    object that we created in the <a class="xref" href="Create_and_configure_the_Ground_Station_and_related_parameters.html" title="Create and configure the Ground Station and related parameters">Create and configure the Ground Station and related
    parameters</a> section. The 5th field, 11111, is the

    related parameters</a> section.</p><p>The 6th field, 26016945.24902344, is the actual DSN range
    observation value in RU.</p><p>The 7th field, 2, is an integer which represents the Uplink Band of
    the uplink <span class="guilabel">GroundStation</span>, <span class="guilabel">CAN</span>.
    The designation, 2, represents X-band. See the
    <span class="guilabel">RunSimulator</span> Help for a detailed discussion of how
    GMAT determines what value should be written here. As described in the
    Help, since we are not using a ramp table, GMAT determines the Uplink Band
    by looking at the transmit frequency of the
    <span class="guilabel">Transmitter</span> object attached to the
    <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> ground station. GMAT knows that the 7200 MHz
    value that we assigned to <span class="guilabel">CAN&rsquo;s</span>
    <span class="guilabel">Transmitter</span> resource,
    <span class="guilabel">DSNTransmitter</span>, corresponds to an X-band
    frequency.</p><p>The 8th field, 7.2e+009, is the transmit frequency of
    <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> at the time of the measurement. Since we are not
    using a ramp table, this value will be constant for all measurements and
    it is given by the value of the frequency of the
    <span class="guilabel">Transmitter</span> object,
    <span class="guilabel">DSNTransmitter</span>, that we attached to the
    <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> ground station. Recall the following script
    segment, <code class="code">DSNTransmitter.Frequency = 7200; %MHz</code>, from the
    <a class="xref" href="Create_and_configure_the_Ground_Station_and_related_parameters.html" title="Create and configure the Ground Station and related parameters">Create and configure the Ground Station and related
    parameters</a> section.</p><p>The 9th field, 3.3554432e+007, represents the integer range modulo
    number that helps define the DSN range measurement. This is the value that

    way Doppler measurement at the start of the simulation at '19 Aug 2015
    00:00:00.000 UTCG&rsquo; which corresponds to the output TAI modified Julian Day
    of 27253.500405092593 TAIMJD.</p><p>The second and third fields, Doppler and 9006, are just internal
    GMAT codes indicating the use of DSN Doppler (derived from two successive
    Trk 2-34 type 17 Total Count Phase measurements) data.</p><p>The 4th field, 22222, is the Downlink station ID. This is the ID we
    gave the <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> GroundStation object that we created in

    represents X-band.</p><p>The 7th field, 10, is the Doppler Count Interval (DCI) used to help
