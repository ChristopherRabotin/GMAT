      script line sets the main antenna that the <span class="guilabel">Receiver</span>
      object will be using. As previously mentioned, the

      include it here both because GMAT requires it and for completeness since
      the <span class="guilabel">Antenna</span> resource may have a function in a
      future GMAT release. Finally, we set the transmitter frequency in the
      last GMAT script line above. See the <span class="guilabel">RunSimulator</span>
      Help for a complete description of how this input frequency is used. As
      described in the Help, since in this example we will not be using a ramp

      now create the ground station error models. Since we wish to simulate

      which indicates that it is an error model for DSN sequential range

      is set to 10.63 Range Units (RU) and the measurement bias is set to 0

      The error model Type is DSN_TCP which indicates that it is an error

      <span class="guilabel">ErrorModel</span> resources we have just created to the
      <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> <span class="guilabel">GroundStation</span>. Note that
      in GMAT, the measurement noise or bias is defined on a per ground
      station basis. Thus, any range measurement error involving the CAN
      GroundStation is defined by the <span class="guilabel">DSNRange</span>

      that since GMAT currently only models two way measurements where the
      transmitting and receiving ground stations are the same, we do not have
      to consider the case where the transmitting and receiving ground
      stations are different. Suppose we were to add an additional
      <span class="guilabel">GroundStation</span> to this simulation. The measurement
      error for observations involving this new
