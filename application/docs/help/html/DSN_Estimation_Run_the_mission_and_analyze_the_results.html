   Sat.SunMJ2000Eq.VZ = -10.662</pre><p>Next, GMAT outputs some data associated with the initial iteration
      of the Outer Loop Sigma Editing (OLSE) process as shown below.</p><pre class="programlisting">Number of Records Removed Due To:
   . No Computed Value Configuration Available : 0
   . Out of Ramp Table Range   : 0
   . Signal Blocked            : 0
   . Initial RMS Sigma Filter  : 0
   . Outer-Loop Sigma Editor   : 0
Number of records used for estimation: 1348</pre><p>As previously
      mentioned, the OLSE process can edit (i.e., remove) certain data from
      use as part of the estimation algorithm. There are five conditions which
      could cause a data point to be edited. For each condition, the output
      above specifies how many data points were edited. We now discuss the
      meaning of the five conditions.</p><p>The first condition, &ldquo;No Computed Value Configuration Available&rdquo;
      means that GMAT has read in some measurement data but no corresponding
      tracking configuration has been defined in the GMAT script. Thus, GMAT
      has no way to form the computed, C, value of the measurement. For
      example, this might happen if our script did not define a
      <span class="guilabel">GroundStation</span> object corresponding to some data in
      the GMD file. Since we have defined everything we need to, no data
      points are edited for this condition.</p><p>The second condition, &ldquo;Out of Ramp Table Range,&rdquo; means that while
      solving the light time equations, GMAT needs to know the transmit
      frequency, for some ground station, at a time that is not covered by the
      ramp table specified in our <span class="guilabel">TrackingFileSet</span>
      resource, <span class="guilabel">DSNsimData</span>. Looking at our input GMD
      file, we see that our measurement times range from 27253.5004166... to
      27274.5004166666... TAIMJD. Since our ramp table has a ramp record for
      all three ground stations at 27252 TAIMJD which is about 1 &frac12; days before
      the first measurement and since our <span class="emphasis"><em>a priori</em></span>
      Cartesian state estimate is fairly good, it makes sense that no
      measurements were edited for this condition.</p><p>The third condition, &ldquo;Signal Blocked,&rdquo; indicates that while taking
      into account its current estimate of the state, GMAT calculates that a
      measurement for a certain measurement strand is not possible because the
      signal is &ldquo;blocked.&rdquo; Actually, the signal does not have to blocked, it
      just has to violate the minimum elevation angle constraint associated
      with a given ground station. Consider a <span class="guilabel">GDS</span> to
      <span class="guilabel">Sat</span> to <span class="guilabel">GDS</span> range two way range
      measurement at given time. If the <span class="guilabel">GDS</span> to
      <span class="guilabel">Sat</span> elevation angle was 6 degrees, the measurement
      would be edited out since the minimum elevation angle, as specified by
      the <span class="guilabel">GDS.MinimumElevationAngle</span> field, is set at 7
      degrees. Since, in our simulation, we specified that only data meeting
      this 7 degree constraint should be written out, it is plausible that no
      data were edited because of this condition.</p><p>The fourth condition, &ldquo;Initial RMS Sigma Filter,&rdquo; corresponds to
      GMAT&rsquo;s OLSE processing for the initial iteration. As mentioned before,
      you can find a complete description of the OLSE in the &ldquo;Behavior of
      Outer Loop Sigma Editing (OLSE)&rdquo; discussion in the
      <span class="guilabel">BatchEstimator</span> Help. As described in the Help, for
      the initial iteration, data is edited if</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Weighted Measurement Residual| &gt;
      <span class="guilabel">OLSEInitialRMSSigma</span></p><p>where the Weighted Measurement Residual for a given measurement is
      given by</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(O-C)/<span class="guilabel">NoiseSigma</span></p><p>and where <span class="guilabel">NoiseSigma</span> are inputs that we set
      when we created the various <span class="guilabel">ErrorModel</span>
      resources.</p><p>We note that for a good orbit solution, the Weighted Measurement
      Residual has a value of approximately one. Since our <span class="emphasis"><em>a
      priori</em></span> state estimate is not that far off from the truth and
      since we have set <span class="guilabel">OLSEInitialRMSSigma</span> to a very
      large value of 10,000, we do not expect any data to be edited for this
      condition.</p><p>The fifth condition, &ldquo;Outer-Loop Sigma Editor,&rdquo; corresponds to
      GMAT&rsquo;s OLSE processing for the second or later iteration. Since the
      output we are analyzing is for the initial iteration of the batch
      estimator, the number of data points edited because of this condition is
      0. We will discuss the OLSE processing for the second or later
      iterations when we analyze the output for a later iteration.</p><pre class="programlisting">   WeightedRMS residuals for this iteration : 1459.96324774
   BestRMS residuals                        : 1459.96324774
   PredictedRMS residuals for next iteration: 0.977684716761
</pre><p>The first output line above gives the weighted RMS calculated when
      the estimate of the state is the input a priori state (i.e., the 0th
      iteration state). The weighted RMS value of approximately 1460 is
      significantly far away from the value of 1 associated with a good orbit
      solution. The second output line gives the best (smallest) weighted RMS
      value for all of the iterations. Since this is our initial iteration,
      the value of the BestRMS is the same as the WeightedRMS. The third
      output line is the predicted weighted RMS value for the next iteration.
      Because of the random noise involved in generating the simulated input
      data, the numbers you see will differ from that above.</p><p>Next, GMAT outputs the state associated with the first iteration
      of the batch estimator. Let&rsquo;s define what we mean by iteration. The
      state at iteration &lsquo;n&rsquo; is the state after GMAT has solved the so-called
      normal equations (e.g., Eq. 4.3.22 or 4.3.25 in Tapley [2004]) &lsquo;n&rsquo;
      successive times. By convention, the state at iteration 0 is the input
      <span class="emphasis"><em>a priori</em></span> state.</p><pre class="programlisting">------------------------------------------------------

   . Out of Ramp Table Range   : 0
   . Signal Blocked : 0
   . Initial RMS Sigma Filter  : 0
   . Outer-Loop Sigma Editor : 1
Number of records used for estimation: 1347</pre><p>For the same reasons we discussed for the initial 0th iteration,
      as expected, no data points were edited because &ldquo;No Computed Value
      Configuration Available&rdquo; or because a requested frequency was &ldquo;Out of
      Ramp Table Range.&rdquo; Also, for the same reasons discussed for the 0th
      iteration, it is plausible that no data points were edited for this
      iteration because of signal blockage. Note that there are no data points
      edited because of the &ldquo;Initial RMS Sigma Filter&rdquo; condition. This is as
      expected because this condition only edits data on the initial 0th
      iteration. Finally, we note that, in this example, 1 data point out of
      1348 data points are edited because of the OLSE condition. Due to the
      randomness of the noise added in the simulation step, you may see more
      or fewer points edited.</p><p>As discussed in the &ldquo;Behavior of Outer Loop Sigma Editing (OLSE)&rdquo;
      section in the <span class="guilabel">BatchEstimator</span> Help,&rdquo; data is edited
      if</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Weighted Measurement Residual| &gt;
      OLSEMultiplicativeConstant * WRMSP + OLSEAdditiveConstant</p><p>where</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WRMSP is the predicted weighted RMS calculated at the end
      of the previous iteration.</p><p>In the <a class="xref" href="DSN_Estimation_Create_and_configure_BatchEstimator_object.html" title="Create and configure BatchEstimator object">Create and configure BatchEstimator object</a> section, we chose
      <span class="guilabel">OLSEMultiplicativeConstant</span> = 3 and
      <span class="guilabel">OLSEAdditiveConstant</span> = 0 and thus the equation
      above becomes</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Weighted Measurement Residual| &gt; 3 * WRMSP</p><p>It is a good sign that only a few points are edited out. If too
      much data is edited out, even if you have a good weighted RMS value, it
      indicates that you may have a problem with your state estimate. Next,
      GMAT outputs some root mean square, (RMS), statistical data associated
      with iteration 1.</p><pre class="programlisting">   WeightedRMS residuals for this iteration : 0.974259069508
   BestRMS residuals                        : 0.974259069508
   PredictedRMS residuals for next iteration: 0.974224174165
</pre><p>The first output line above gives the weighted RMS calculated when
      the estimate of the state is the iteration 1 state. The weighted RMS
      value shown here of 0.974 is close to the value of 1 associated with a
      good orbit solution. The second output line gives the best (smallest)
      weighted RMS value for all of the iterations. Since this iteration 1
      WeightedRMS value is the best so far, BestRMS is set to the current
      WeightedRMS value. The third output line is the predicted weighted RMS
      value for the next iteration. Note that the RMS values calculated above
      only use data points that are used to form the state estimate. Thus, the
      edited points are not used to calculate the RMS.</p><p>Because the predicted WeightedRMS value is very close to the
      BestRMS value, GMAT, as shown in the output below, concludes that the
      estimation process has converged. As previously mentioned, see the
      &ldquo;Behavior of Convergence Criteria&rdquo; discussion in the

      measurement type basis. We elaborate on what this means. When the script
      first runs, the first plots that show up are the 0th iteration
      residuals. This means that when calculating the &lsquo;O-C&rsquo; observation
      residual, GMAT calculates the Computed, C, value of the residual using
      the a priori state. As shown in <a class="xref" href="DSN_Estimation_Appendix_B.html" title="Appendix B &ndash; Zeroth Iteration Plots of Observation Residuals">Appendix B &ndash; Zeroth Iteration Plots of Observation
    Residuals</a>, there
      are 6 of these 0th iteration residual plots. For each of the 3 stations,
      there is one plot of the range residuals and one plot of the Doppler
      residuals. After iteration 1 processing is complete, GMAT outputs the
      iteration 1 residuals as shown in <a class="xref" href="DSN_Estimation_Appendix_C.html" title="Appendix C &ndash; First Iteration Plots of Observation Residuals">Appendix C &ndash; First Iteration Plots of Observation Residuals</a>. As
      previously mentioned, although for this script, GMAT takes two
      iterations to converge, the actual iteration 2 residuals are neither
      calculated nor plotted.
      DSN_Estimation_Create_and_configure_the_Ground_Station_and_related_parameters</p><p>We now analyze the CAN range and Doppler residuals. For the 0th
      iteration, the range residuals vary from approximately 11,000 to 31,000
      RU. These residuals are this large because our a priori estimate of the
      state was deliberately perturbed from the truth. There are multiple
      indicators on this graph that indicate that GMAT has not yet converged.
      First, the residuals have an approximate linear structure. If you have
      modeled the dynamics and measurements correctly, the plots should have a
      random appearance with no structure. Additionally, the residuals are
      biased, i.e., they do not have zero mean. For a well modeled system, the
      mean value of the residuals should be near zero. Finally, the magnitude
      of the range residuals is significantly too large. Recall that in the
      <a class="xref" href="DSN_Estimation_Create_and_configure_the_Ground_Station_and_related_parameters.html" title="Create and configure the Ground Station and related parameters">Create and configure the Ground Station and related
    parameters</a> section, we set the 1 sigma measurement noise
      for the CAN range measurements to 10.63 RU. Thus, for a large sample of
      measurements, we expect, roughly, that the vast majority of measurements
      will lie between the values of approximately -32 and +32 RU. Taking a
      look at the 1st iteration CAN range residuals, this is, approximately,
      what we get.</p><p>The 0th iteration <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> Doppler residuals range
      from approximately 0.0050 to 0.01535 Hz. As was the case for the range
      0th iteration residuals, the fact that the Doppler residuals are biased
      indicates that GMAT has not yet converged. Recall that in the <a class="xref" href="DSN_Estimation_Create_and_configure_the_Ground_Station_and_related_parameters.html" title="Create and configure the Ground Station and related parameters">Create and configure the Ground Station and related
    parameters</a> section, we set the 1 sigma measurement noise
      for the <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> Doppler measurements to 0.0282 Hz.
      Thus, for a large sample of measurements, we expect, roughly, that the
      vast majority of measurements will lie between the values of
      approximately -0.0846 and +0.0846 RU. Taking a look at the 1st iteration
      <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> Doppler residuals, this is, approximately, what
      we get.</p><p>There is one important detail on these graphs that you should be
      aware of. GMAT only plots the residuals for data points that are
      actually used to calculate the solution. Recall that for iteration 0,
      all 1348 of 1348 total measurements were used to calculate the orbit
      state, i.e., no data points were edited. Thus, if you counted up all the
      data points on the 6 iteration 0 plots, you would find 1348 points. The
      situation is different for the 1st iteration. Recall that for iteration
      1, 1347 of 1348 total measurements were used to calculate the orbit
      state, i.e., 1 data point was edited. Thus, if you counted up all the
      data points on the 6 iteration 1 plots, you would find 1347 points. If
      you wish to generate plots that contain both non-edited and edited
      measurements, you will need to generate them yourself using the MATLAB
      output file as discussed in the <a class="xref" href="DSN_Estimation_Run_the_mission_and_analyze_the_results.html#DSN_Estimation_Matlab_Output_File" title="Matlab Output File">Matlab Output File</a>
      section.</p><p>We note that the graphs have some interactive features. Hover your
      mouse over the graph of interest and then right click. You will see that
      you have four options. You can toggle both the grid lines and the Legend
      on and off. You can also export the graph data to a text file, and
      finally, you can export the graph image to a bmp file.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DSN_Estimation_Batch_Estimator_Output_Report"></a>Batch Estimator Output Report</h3></div></div></div><p>When we created our BatchEstimator resource, bat, in the <a class="xref" href="DSN_Estimation_Create_and_configure_BatchEstimator_object.html" title="Create and configure BatchEstimator object">Create and configure BatchEstimator object</a> section, we specified that the output file
      name would be 'Orbit Estimation using DSN Range and Doppler Data.report.
      Go to GMAT&rsquo;s &lsquo;output&rsquo; directory and open this file, preferably using an
      editor such as Notepad++ where you can easily scroll across the rows of
      data.</p><p>The first approximately 150 lines of the report are mainly an echo
      of the parameters we input into the script such as initial spacecraft
      state, force model, propagator settings, measurement types to be
      processed, etc.</p><p>After this echo of the input data, the output report contains
      measurement residuals associated with the initial 0th iteration. Search
      the file for the words, &lsquo;ITERATION 0: MEASUREMENT RESIDUALS&rsquo; to find the
      location of where the relevant output begins. This output sections
      contains information on all of the measurements, both non-edited and
      edited, that can possibly be used in the estimation process. Each row of
      data corresponds to one measurement. For each measurement, the output
      tells you the following</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Iteration Number</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Record Number</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Epoch in UTC Gregorian format</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Observation type. &lsquo;DSN_SeqRange&rsquo; corresponds to DSN sequential

          your measurement comes from a <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> to

In particular, we
      discussed the various reasons why data might be edited. If no edit code
      is shown for a residual record, this means that the data was not edited
      and the data was used, for this iteration, to calculate a state
      estimate.</p><p>Note that if the elevation angle of any of the measurements is
      below our input criteria of 7 degrees, then the measurement would be
      edited because the signal would be considered to be &ldquo;blocked.&rdquo; For range
      data, we would see Bn where n is an integer specifying the leg number.
      For our two way range data type, we have two legs, the uplink leg
      represented by the integer, 1, and the downlink leg, represented by the
      integer 2. Thus, if we saw &ldquo;B1&rdquo; in this field, this would mean that the
      signal was blocked for the uplink leg. Correspondingly, for Doppler
      data, we would also see Bn, but the integer n would be 1 or 2 depending
      upon whether the blockage occurred in the start path (n=1) or the end
      path (n=2).</p><p>After all of the individual iteration 0 residuals are printed out,
      four different iteration 0 observation summary reports, as shown below,
      are printed out.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Observation Summary by Station and Data Type</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Observation Summary by Data Type and Station</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Observation Summary by Station</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Observation Summary by Data Type</p></li></ul></div><p>After all of the observation summaries are printed out, the
      updated state and covariance information, obtained by processing the
      previous residual information, are printed out. The output also contains
      statistical information about how much the individual components of the
      state estimate have changed for this iteration.</p><p>At this point, the output content repeats itself for the next
      iteration. The new state estimate is used to calculate new residuals and
      the process starts all over again. The process stops when the estimator
      has either converged or diverged.</p><p>We now give an example of how this report can be used. In the
      <a class="xref" href="DSN_Estimation_Run_the_mission_and_analyze_the_results.html#DSN_Estimation_Message_Window_Output" title="Message Window Output">Message Window Output</a> section, we noted that, for iteration 1, some
      measurements were edited because of the OLSE criteria. Let&rsquo;s investigate
      this in more detail. What type of data was edited? From what station?
      Could there be a problem with this data type at this station? We look at
      the &lsquo;Observation Summary by Station and Data Type&rsquo; for iteration 1. We
      see that one range measurement from the <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> station
      was edited. The mean residual and 1-sigma standard deviation for
      <span class="guilabel">GDS</span> range measurements was -0.222339 and 10.082896
      RU, respectively. The mean residual and 1-sigma standard deviation for
      <span class="guilabel">MAD</span> range measurements was 0.199925 and 10.205535
      RU, respectively.</p><p>Now that we know that the issue was with <span class="guilabel">GDS</span>
      and <span class="guilabel">MAD</span> range measurements, we look at the detailed
      residual output, for iteration 1, to determine the time these
      measurements occurred. We can search for the OLSE keyword to help do
      this. We determine that a <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> range measurement was
      edited at 02 Sep 2015 04:00:00.000 UTCG and that it had an observation
      residual of -33.161377 RU. This is just a bit beyond the 3-sigma value
      and we conclude that there is no real problem with the
      <span class="guilabel">CAN</span> range measurements. This is just normal
      statistical variation.</p><p>We remind you, that when you do your run, you may have a different
      number of data points edited. This is because, when you do your
      simulation, GMAT uses a random number generator and you will be using a
      different data set.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DSN_Estimation_Matlab_Output_File"></a>Matlab Output File</h3></div></div></div><p>In the <a class="xref" href="DSN_Estimation_Create_and_configure_BatchEstimator_object.html" title="Create and configure BatchEstimator object">Create and configure BatchEstimator object</a> section, when we created our
