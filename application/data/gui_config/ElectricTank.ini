[FuelMass]
Hint=The total mass of fuel available in the fuel tank.\nCaution: By default, GMAT will not allow the fuel mass to be negative. However, occasionally \nin iterative processes such as targeting, a solver will try values of a maneuver parameter \nthat result in total fuel depletion. Using the default tank settings this will throw an \nexcpeption stopping the run unless you set the AllowNegativeFuelMass flag to true.

Hint=This field allows the fuel tank to have negagive fuel mass which can be useful in \noptimization and targeting sequences before convergences has occurred.
