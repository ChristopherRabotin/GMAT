    "Before the API can be used, it needs to be loaded into the Python system and initialized using a GMAT startup file.  This can be done from the GMAT bin folder by importing the gmatpy module, but using that approach tends to leave files in the bin folder that may annoy other users.  Running from an outside folder takes a few steps, which have been captured in the load_gmat.py file in the GMAT api folder.  After preparing the API for use (see the API \"read me\" file, api/API_README.txt), copy load_gmat.py into the folder you are using for Jupyter notebooks.  Then import it:"
