Welcome to the wonderful world of GMAT!

GMAT is a space trajectory optimization and mission analysis system
developed by NASA and private industry in the spirit of the NASA
Vision. It is a collaboratively developed, open-source tool written to
enable the development of new mission concepts and to improve current
missions.

                      Installation and Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The GMAT Windows distribution contains an installer that will
install and configure GMAT for you automatically. The installer
does not require administrative privileges, and will install by
default to your personal AppData\Local folder. This can be customized
during installation.

GMAT is distributed in source form as well, and can be compiled on the
Mac and on Linux. It has not been rigorously tested on these platforms,
though.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Running GMAT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
On Windows, click Start, and then point to All Programs. Point to GMAT,
and then click GMAT R2012a. If you are using the zip-file bundle, start
the bin\GMAT.exe application.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Documentation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
GMAT is extensively documented in the docs folder of this distribution.
End-user documentation can be found in the docs\help folder (for offline
use) or online at http://gmat.sf.net/docs.

            HOW TO RUN THE DEMOS INCLUDED IN THIS DISTRIBUTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We've included nearly 40 sample missions in the distribution.
The sample missions show how to apply GMAT to problems ranging from
the Hohmann transfer to Libration point stationkeeping to trajectory
optimization.

Here are instructions for running the sample missions:

  - Download and install the GMAT application.
  - Start GMAT and choose File > Open from the menu.
  - Navigate to the samples folder which is
    located in the GMAT root directory.
  - Choose the script file of your choice.
  - Click the blue "Run" button on the toolbar
    and watch the mission evolve.

NOTE: There are several samples that require enabling optional plugins.
For those samples in the NeedMatlab folder, you must enable the
libMatlabInterface plugin in the gmat_startup_file.txt (located in the bin
folder). External configuration is necessary to successfully connect
to Matlab. See the documentation for instructions. The NeedVF13ad folder
contains samples that require libVf13adOptimizer, which is not shipped
with this distribution. It is available for internal NASA users. Other
users will be able to find instructions on the forums for building and
using the VF13ad optimizer soon. Finally, those samples in the
PreliminaryEstimation folder require the libGmatEstimation plugin to be
enabled in the gmat_startup_file.txt. GMAT's estimation features in this
release are of alpha quality, and are included here as a preview only.
