/**
 *  The measurement data structure
 *
 *  This class acts mostly as a structure which provides the core set of
 *  information used for calculated measurement data.  Each measurement can be
 *  captured in this structure.
 *
 *  This struct presents as a class because it includes code for the assignment
 *  operator and copy constructor.  To me, it's just bad form to call something
 *  a struct and include those pieces.
