C       TEDER changed
C       All names with 6 or more characters replaced 
C       10/29/91 XEN: 10^ in loop, instead of at the end
C       1/21/93 B0_TAB instead of B0POL
C       9/22/94 Alleviate underflow condition in IONCOM exp()
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c changes from IRIF12 to IRIF13:
C        9/18/95 MODA: add leap year and number of days in month
C        9/29/95 replace F2out with FOUT and XMOUT.
C       10/ 5/95 add TN and DTNDH; earlier in CIRA86.FOR

C IONLOW calculates relative density of O+, H+, He+ or N+  in the outer
C ionosphere for a low solar activity (F107 < 100).
C Based on spherical harmonics approximation of relative ion density
C (by AE-C, and AE-E) at altitudes centred on 400km, 650km, and 1000km.
C For intermediate altitudes an interpolation is used. 
C Recommended altitude range: 350-2000 km!!!
C For days between seasons centred at (21.3. = 79; 21.6. = 171;
C 23.9. 265; 21.12. = 354) relative ion density is linearly interpolated.

c Rz12 and IG are determined from the file IG_RZ.DAT which has the
c following structure: 
c day, month, year of the last update of this file,
c start month, start year, end month, end year,
c the 12 IG indices (13-months running mean) for the first year, 
c the 12 IG indices for the second year and so on until the end year,
c the 12 Rz indices (13-months running mean) for the first year,
c the 12 Rz indices for the second year and so on until the end year.
c The inteporlation procedure also requires the IG and Rz values for
c the month preceeding the start month and the IG and Rz values for the
c month following the end month. These values are also included in 
c IG_RZ.
c 
c A negative Rz index means that the given index is the 13-months-
C running mean of the solar radio flux (F10.7). The close correlation 
C between (Rz)12 and (F10.7)12 is used to derive the (Rz)12 indices.
c
c An IG index of -111 indicates that no IG values are available for the
c time period. In this case a correlation function between (IG)12 and 
C (Rz)12 is used to obtain (IG)12.
c
c The computation of the 13-month-running mean for month M requires the
c indices for the six months preceeding M and the six months following 
C M (month: M-6, ..., M+6). To calculate the current running mean one 
C therefore requires predictions of the indix for the next six months. 
C Starting from six months before the UPDATE DATE (listed at the top of 
c the file) and onward the indices are therefore based on indices 
c predictions.

      SUBROUTINE STORM(ap,rga,rgo,coor,rgma,ut,doy,cf)
C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C      Fortran code to obtain the foF2 storm-time correction factor at 
C      a given location and time, using the current and the 12 previous
C      ap values as input.
C
C      ap ---> (13 elements integer array). Array with the preceeding
C              13 value of the 3-hourly ap index. The 13th value
C              in the array will contain the ap at the UT of interest,
C              the 12th value will contain the 1st three hourly interval
C              preceeding the time of interest, and so on to the 1st
C              ap value at the earliest time.
C     coor --> (integer). If coor = 2, rga should contain the 
C                         geomagnetic latitude.
C                         If coor = 1, rga should contain the 
C                         geographic latitude.
C     rga ---> (real, -90 to 90) geographic or geomagnetic latitude.
C     rgo ---> (real, 0 to 360, positive east from Greenwich.)
C                           geographic longitude, only used if coor=1.
C     ut  ---> (integer, hours 00 to 23) Universal Time of interest.
C     doy ---> (integer, 1 to 366)Day of the year.
C     cf  ---> (real) The output; the storm-time correction factor used
C              to scale foF2, foF2 * cf.

C Includes subroutines IRI_SUB and IRI_WEB to compute IRI parameters 
C for specified location, date, time, and altitude range and subroutine 
C IRI_WEB to computes IRI parameters for specified location, date, time 
C and variable range; variable can be altitude, latitude, longitude, 
C year, month, day of month, day of year, or hour (UT or LT). 
C IRI_WEB requires IRI_SUB. Both subroutines require linking with the 
c following library files IRIFUN.FOR, IRITEC.FOR, IRIDREG.FOR, 
c CIRA.FOR, IGRF.FOR
c 
c !!!!! Subroutine INITIALIZE has to be called once before calling
c !!!!! iri_sub. This is already included in subroutine IRI_WEB which
c !!!!! calls iri_sub.
