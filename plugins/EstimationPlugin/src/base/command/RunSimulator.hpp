/**
 * Mission Control Sequence Command that runs data simulation
 *
 * This command uses a simulator to generate simulated measurement data that can
 * be processed by GMAT's estimators.  The Simulator class contains the elements
 * that actually manage the simulation process, including a finite state machine
 * that walks the system through the process of data simulation.
 *
 * Simulated data generated by this command is generated through propagation
 * using a pre-configured propagator.  The ODEModel used in this process is set
 * prior to execution of the command.  That means that the simulated data
 * generated in this process does not include any transient forces.
