/**
 * \mainpage API for the GMAT Estimation Plugin
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The estimation capabilities of GMAT are provided through plug-in code loaded
 * into GMAT at run time.  The design for the components of the plug-in can be
 * found in the GMAT Estimation Specification, which is volume 2 of GMAT's
 * Architectural Specification.
 *
 * This document provides a static, low level guide to the code in the
 * estimation plug-in.  The text of this document is generated directly from the
 * source code for the plug-in.  It is built on the comments contained in that
 * code, and matches the contents to the extent that the comments match the
 * implementation.  The class attributes and methods are parsed directly from
 * the source, and are therefore guaranteed to match the source code at the time
 * this document was generated.
 *
 * GMAT's estimation capabilities are a work in progress.  As such, this
 * document will become stale over time.  It is built using the Doxygen
 * documentation tool.  We recommend that a fresh version of the document
 * be generated prior to use as a reference guide for new developers.
