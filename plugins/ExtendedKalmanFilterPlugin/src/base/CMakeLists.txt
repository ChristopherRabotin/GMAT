# CMake template script for GMAT plugins
#
# Modify this script as needed for your own plugin, and place it in your
# plugin's src/base directory.
#
# GMAT maintainers should update this template as appropriate to reflect
# new build system capabilities.
#
# Instructions:
#  - Create your plugin according to standard GMAT plugin conventions
#  - Copy this file to your plugin's src/base directory, name it CMakeLists.txt
#  - Follow the comment instructions below. You can use CMakeLists.txt files
#    from existing GMAT plugins as a guide.
#  - Update the <GMAT>/plugins/CMakeLists.txt file by adding references
#    to this plugin at appropriate places.
