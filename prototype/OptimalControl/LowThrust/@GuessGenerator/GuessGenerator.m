    %   GuessGenerator Class to generate optimal control initial guess
    %   state and control.
    %
    %   This class computes the initial guess for optimal control problems
    %   Inputs are the dimensions of the problem, discretization points,
    %   and details required to compute the initial guess (method, 
    %   and possibly pointers to user dynamics functions.  
    %   The returned values are the guess for the states and controls at
    %   the discretizetion points
