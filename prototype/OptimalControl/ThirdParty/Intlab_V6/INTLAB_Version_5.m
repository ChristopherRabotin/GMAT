%Help file for INTLAB Version 5
%
% - Hessian toolbox added
% - verifynlss for sparse s.p.d. Jacobian (or Hessian)
% - Verifylss for dense systems with one or two stages, and with quadruple precision residual
% - Verifynlss with changed stopping criterion
% - function intlabsetting added
% - function sparsegradient controls sparse/full gradient derivative
% - dot_ complex data allowed
% - gradient/abs (and hessian/abs) for zero arguments allowed
% - rounding to nearest after calling an INTLAB routine
% - function longshift added
% - function isconst removed
% - functionality gradient/issparse changed
% - random matrices of extremely large condition number
% - gradient and slope full/sparse added
% - intval/ischar deleted
% - logical odd/even added
% - gradient output changed (only for row vectors and matrices of gradients, see gradient/gradient)
% - demointval Wilkinson example changed due to Matlab different eigenvalue approx. ordering
%
%Several performance improvements, especially for sparse data.
