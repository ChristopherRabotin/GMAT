%% DEMOSLOPE  Short demonstration of slopes
%

%% Some sample applications of the Hessian toolbox
% Hessians implement second order automatic differentiation in forward mode, which is
% conveniently to implement using the Matlab operator concept.
%
% For a demonstration of the slope toolbox, intervals are wide; therefore, output 
% is switched to infimum/supremum representation (see demointval):
                           
setround(0)                           % set rounding to nearest
format compact short infsup
        
%% Slope expansions
% In order to use slope expansions, the expansion range and expansion 
% point (interval) need to be identified and values have to be assigned. 
% This is performed by the function "slopeinit", for example        
        
u = slopeinit( [1;2] , infsup([1;2],[1.1;2.1]) )
        
%% 
% The length (number of rows) is the number 
% of independent variables, in the example above two. Slopes are always 
% of type intval. For definition and use of slopes cf. Neumaier's book
% on interval analysis.
        
%% Computing with slopes 
% Automatic slope expansion is performed by operations with slope variables. 
% For example,                                                                                                                                            
        
x = slopeinit(3.5,midrad(3.5,1e-4));  
y = exp(3*x-sqrt(x))
        
%%
% evaluates the expression using slopes with expansion point 3.5 and expansion
% interval 3.5+/-1e-4. 
%
% There is access to the center value, the range and 
% the slope of y:
        
y.c
y.r
y.s
        
%%
% When evaluating the expression for another argument, e.g. a vector argument,
% use the same statement as before with new values.
        
xs = [2;3];  
x = slopeinit(xs,midrad(xs,1e-4));  
y = exp(3*x-sqrt(x))

%% Graphical illustration of slopes
% There is a simple graphic to demonstrate the behaviour of slope expansions for 
% one-dimensional functions. The routine "slopeplot" assumes a function
% in one variable which can be evaluated for vectors, the expansion
% point and the expansion interval.
% For example, 
  
format short
slopeplot('(x-2).*exp(x)-sqrt(abs(x))',1,infsup(1,2))
        
%%
% shows a best possible upper slope, but an underestimated lower slope.

%% Non-differentiable functions
% Functions to be handled by slopes need not be differentiable. 
% An example is sqrt(abs(x)). Consider 
        
slopeplot('sqrt(abs(x))',-2,infsup(-1,1))
        
%% 
% The slope is best possible, but the grid is not fine enough to catch the
% extreme point at zero. For some 10000 grid points the picture looks
% as follows:
        
slopeplot('sqrt(abs(x))',-2,infsup(-1,1),[],10000)
    
%% Computation of the Gamma function with slopes
% Consider the following example in one unknown.                            
% According to Stirling's formula it is for u -> inf,                       
%                                                                           
%                          1      1       139        571                    
%    Gamma(u) ~ C * ( 1 + --- + ----- - ------- - --------- + ... )         
%                         12u       2         3           4

%         -u  u-0.5                                                         
%    C = e   u      sqrt(2*pi) .                                            
%                                                                           
% The following function evaluates Stirling's formula. It is also           
% suited for vector input.                                                  
%                                                                           
%                                                                           
%   function y = g(u)                                                     
%       C = exp(-u) .* ( u.^(u-0.5) ) * sqrt(2.0*pi) ;                          
%       v = (((( -571.0/2488320.0 ./ u - 139.0/51840.0 ) ./ u ...               
%                 + 1.0/288.0) ./ u ) + 1.0/12.0 ) ./ u + 1.0;                  
%       y = C .* v;                                                             
%        
% A corresponding inline function is

format long e
g = @(u) ( ( exp(-u) .* ( u.^(u-0.5) ) * sqrt(2.0*pi) ) .* ...
           ( (((( -571.0/2488320.0 ./ u - 139.0/51840.0 ) ./ u ...           
             + 1.0/288.0) ./ u ) + 1.0/12.0 ) ./ u + 1.0 ) )
u = [ 3.5 61 5 ]
g(u)
        
%% Computation of the range of the function g
% Next calculate the range of the function g within 
% a certain interval. This can be performed, for example, by straightforward 
% interval evluation (naive interval arithmetic) 

format long
X = infsup(4.1,4.2);  
Y = g(X)

%%
% or by slopes:
        
xs = 4.1;  
X = infsup(4.1,4.2);  
Ys = g(slopeinit(xs,X))
   
%%
% The range computed by the slope expansion is better by a factor 2 than 
% naive interval arithmetic and less than 20 % overestimation of the true range:
      
diam(Y)
diam(Ys.r)
g(4.2)-g(4.1)

%%
% Note that Y or Ys.r is an inclusion of the range of g; for an inclusion 
% of the range of the Gamma function an error
% term has to be added.

%% Slopes in several unknowns
% Automatic slope expansion with several unknowns works the same way.  
% Consider the following example by Broyden. 
%                                                                               
%                                .5*sin(x1*x2) - x2/(4*pi) - x1/2  =  0         
%  (1-1/(4*pi))*(exp(2*x1)-exp(1)) + exp(1)*x2/pi - 2*exp(1)*x1 )  =  0         
%                                                                               
% with initial approximation [ .6 ; 3 ] and one solution [ .5 ; pi ].           
% The following function evaluates Broyden's function.                         
%                                                                               
%  function  y = f1(x)                                                           
%     y = x;                                                                     
%     y(1) = .5*sin(x(1)*x(2)) - x(2)/(4*pi) - x(1)/2;                           
%     y(2) = (1-1/(4*pi))*(exp(2*x(1))-exp(1)) + exp(1)*x(2)/pi - 2*exp(1)*x(1); 
%                                                                               
% The first statement is for efficiency. It is generally better to fix the size 
% of an array before assigning values to the components. An inline function
% is as follows (cf. demogradient):                

f = @(x) ( [ .5*sin(x(1)*x(2)) - x(2)/(4*pi) - x(1)/2 ; ...
             (1-1/(4*pi))*(exp(2*x(1))-exp(1)) + exp(1)*x(2)/pi - 2*exp(1)*x(1) ] )        

%% Solution of a nonlinear system
% The nonlinear system defined by Broyden's function can solved by Newton's procedure 
% as follows (cf. demogradient):
 
x = gradientinit([ .6 ; 3 ]);
for i=1:5
  y = f1(x);
  x = x - y.dx\y.x;
end
x
        
%%                                                                           
% For simplicity, we omitted the stopping criterion. 
% Here, y.dx is the Jacobian, y.x the function value at x.x, and -y.dx\y.x  
% is the correction obtained by solution of a linear system.                                                                                        
        
%% Verified solution of a nonlinear system 
% For verified solution of the nonlinear system, we need a correct definition  
% of the function, see demogradient:                     
%                                                                               
%  function  y = f(x)                                                           
%    y = x;
%    c1 = typeadj( 1 , typeof(x) );
%    cpi = typeadj( midrad(3.14159265358979323,1e-16) , typeof(x) );
%    y(1) = .5*sin(x(1)*x(2)) - x(2)/(4*cpi) - x(1)/2;
%    y(2) = (1-1/(4*cpi))*(exp(2*x(1))-exp(c1)) + exp(c1)*x(2)/cpi - 2*exp(c1)*x(1);
%                                                                               
% This code is implemented in the function demotest.m .

%% Verified solution using verifynlss        
% The nonlinear system defined by Broyden's function can be 
% solved with verification and using slopes by:              
        
y = verifynlss('demotest',[ .6 ; 3 ],'s')
                           
%%
% The first parameter gives the name of the function, in this case "demotest",     
% such that "demotest(x)" evaluates the function at "x".                         
% For the last parameter being 's', slopes are used, otherwise gradients (the default).    
%                                                                                 
% We used slopes. However, the inclusion of the error with respect to an approximate
% is computed; therefore, the results for gradient and slope inclusion are identical.
% Note that use of gradients guarantees uniqueness of the zero within the computed
% interval, use of slope does not.                                                                             
        
%% Nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters 
% Next we artificially introduce an interval parameter of large diameter
% in Broyden's function: 
%                                                                               
%  function  y = demotest(x,radius)                                                    
%    y = x;                                                                     
%    if nargin==1                                                               
%      radius = 1e-15; 
%    end
%    cPi = typeadj( midrad(3.141592653589793,radius) , typeof(x) );          
%    y(1) = .5*sin(x(1)*x(2)) - x(2)/(4*cPi) - x(1)/2;                           
%    y(2) = (1-1/(4*cPi))*(exp(2*x(1))-exp(1)) + exp(1)*x(2)/cPi - 2*exp(1)*x(1); 
%                                                                             
% This is to show that the range of applicability is larger for slopes than
% for gradients. For radius .04, both gradient expansion and slope expansion 
% compute an inclusion (the extra parameter is passed to demotest):       

radius = 4e-2; y1 = verifynlss('demotest',[ .6 ; 3 ],'g',[],radius)
radius = 4e-2; y2 = verifynlss('demotest',[ .6 ; 3 ],'s',[],radius)
    
%%
% The inclusion using slopes is better by 10 to 20 % in radius:

[ rad(y1) rad(y2) ]

%% A demo nonlinear function with large uncertainty
% Finally, we enlarge the radius of the parameter cPi to 0.05 and try to 
% calculate an inclusion:
       
radius = 5e-2; y1 = verifynlss('demotest',[ .6 ; 3 ],'g',[],radius)
radius = 5e-2; y2 = verifynlss('demotest',[ .6 ; 3 ],'s',[],radius)
       
%%
% Now, only the slope expansion is able to compute an inclusion.
