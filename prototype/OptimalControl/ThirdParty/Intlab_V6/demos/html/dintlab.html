         <h2>Welcome to INTLAB, the Matlab toolbox for Reliable Computing<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>Following are some examples how to use INTLAB, the Matlab toolbox for Reliable Computing. Since I like pictures, some features
            using the graphical capabilities of INTLAB are demonstrated. Please consult "demo intval" to get acquainted to define and
            use intervals. See also the other demos like gradient, hessian, long, polynom, etc.
         </p>
         <h2>Possible overestimation by interval operations<a name="2"></a></h2>
         <p>As a first example watch possible overestimation by interval operations. Define a 2 x 2 rotation matrix Q rotating by 30 degrees
            and consider the two-dimensional box X with lower left vertex (1,1) and upper right vertex
         </p><pre class="codeinput">format <span class="string">compact</span> <span class="string">short</span> <span class="string">infsup</span>

phi = 30*pi/180;
Q = [ cos(phi) -sin(phi) ; sin(phi) cos(phi) ]

X = [ infsup(1,2) ; infsup(2,4) ]

[    2.0000,    4.0000] 
</pre><h2>The product Q*X: rotation of an interval<a name="3"></a></h2>
         <p>Distinguish between the power set operation Q*X and the interval operation Q*X. By linearity, the power set result is an n-dimensional
            parallelogram. The interval product Q*X, however, must be an interval vector. By definition, it is the smallest interval vector
            containg all possible Q*x for x in X. In blue is the interval result of Q*X, while in red is the true range of Q*x for x in
            X.

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dintlab_01.png"> <h2>Another example of interval overestimation: complex multiplication<a name="4"></a></h2>
         <p>It is the principle of interval operations that they always produce a result which contains all possible results of operations
            between operands in the input operands. Another example of overestimation is complex multiplication. The data for the following
            picture is taken from Markus Grimmer, Wuppertal, presented at the Dagstuhl meeting on "Numerical Software with Result Verification",
            January 2003. The blue circle is the (complex) interval result. Real intervals in INTLAB use inf-sup representation, while
            complex intervals use mid-rad representation.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">kmax = 40; i = sqrt(-1); a=midrad(1,1); b=midrad(-1+i,1);
plotintval(a*b); hold <span class="string">on</span>

[A,B] = meshgrid( mid(a)+rad(a)*exp(i*phi) , mid(b)+rad(b)*exp(i*phi) );
plot(A.*B)
hold <span class="string">off</span>
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dintlab_02.png"> <h2>A model problem for global optimization proposed by Griewank<a name="5"></a></h2>
         <p>The amount of overestimation depends on many things, especially on the formulation of a function. As a rule thumb one might
            say that to diminish overestimation, a single variable should not occur too many times. However, there are many counterexamples
            to that.
         </p>
         <p>Sometimes there is not much overestimation. As an example take the following well known test function for global optimization
            routines proposed by Griewank:
         </p><pre class="codeinput">f = inline(<span class="string">' (x.^2+y.^2)/4000 + cos(x).*cos(y)/sqrt(2) + 1 '</span>)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">f =
     Inline function:
     f(x,y) = (x.^2+y.^2)/4000 + cos(x).*cos(y)/sqrt(2) + 1
</pre><h2>Find the minimum function value, kmax = 20<a name="6"></a></h2>
         <p>The task for a global optimizer is to find the minimum function value for    -60 &lt;= x &lt;= 60    -60 &lt;= y &lt;= 60 To get an impression
            of the function we first take a look at a plot. The following is how it really happened to me.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">kmax = 20;
[x,y] = meshgrid(linspace(-60,60,kmax));
surf(x,y,f(x,y))
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dintlab_03.png"> <h2>Find the minimum function value, kmax = 50<a name="7"></a></h2>
         <p>The surface looks smooth and one might argue why should this be a serious test function for global optimization. However,
            if we repeat the plot with 50 meshpoints in x- and y-direction, then the function decovers its ugly behaviour.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">kmax = 50;
[x,y] = meshgrid(linspace(-60,60,kmax));

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dintlab_04.png"> <h2>Estimation of the range of the Griewank-function over the whole domain by taking the minimum and maximum in the nodes<a name="8"></a></h2>
         <p>The first plot looks nice just because of advantageous plotting nodes. We may try to estimate the range of the function over
            the whole domain by taking the minimum and maximum in the nodes. This is, by construction, always an inner inclusion.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">min(min(f(x,y))), max(max(f(x,y)))

</pre><h2>Inclusion of the range by interval arithmetic<a name="9"></a></h2>
         <p>A true inclusion is easily obtained by interval arithmetic.</p>
         <p>Note that the first estimate required 50*50 = 2500 function evaluation, whereas the validated inclusion requires only one
            interval evaluation. A closer inspection shows that the interval bounds are sharp up to two digits, so in this case there
            is not much overestimation. Unfortunately, this is not always typical.

</pre><h2>A linear system in n=50 unknowns with random entries A_ij<a name="10"></a></h2>
         <p>For a given linear system with data afflicted with tolerances one may want to compute the smallest box around the set of all
            solution for data varying within the tolerances. A common approach for that is Monte Carlo analysis.
         </p>
         <p>Consider a randomly generated linear system with interval matrix A and right hand side b such that  A.mid * x = b  for x =
            ones(n,1). The following generates such a linear system in n=50 unknowns with random entries A_ij uniformly distributed within
            [-0.5,0.5] and each A_ij afflicted with a relative tolerance of 1e-5.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">n = 50; rand(<span class="string">'state'</span>,0)
A = rand(n)-.5; A = midrad(A,1e-5*abs(A)); b = A.mid*ones(n,1);
c = cond(A.mid)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">c =
  110.8905
</pre><h2>Inclusion interval vector X of solution of the interval linear system Ax=b<a name="11"></a></h2>
         <p>The condition number c~1e2 suggests that we may expect a variation of the solution of the order c*1e-5 ~ 1e-3.</p>
         <p>The following computes an inclusion X of the solution set of the interval linear system Ax=b, that is for every C in A the
            true solution of Cx=b is in X. The interval box of the first two components X(1) versus X(2) is plotted.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">X = verifylss(A,b);

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dintlab_05.png"> <h2>Try a Monte Carlo approach<a name="12"></a></h2>
         <p>The size of the box is of the expected order, but is it an overestimation? Note that we know the expected size of X only because
            we computed the condition number of the (midpoint) matrix.
         </p>
         <p>We may try a Monte Carlo approach. In order to obtain large variations of the solution we randomly choose only "vertex" matrices,
            that is matrices C such that C_ij is equal to A_ij.inf or A_ij.sup. We solve  n  such linear systems and plot the first two
            components of the result into the computed inclusion.
         </p>
         <p>Note that this approach took of the order of n^4 operations. The random points suggest that the computed inclusion is quite
            an overestimation of the true range of the first two components.

         <p>However, we may use sign information of an approximate inverse of A.mid to approximate extreme points of the true range of
            the solution. We do this for four linear systems, and the result is plotted into our figure by a circle 'o'.

         <p>These four carefully choosen 'vertex' matrices show that the computed inclusion is indeed sharp! We mention that it does not
            help very much to increase the number of random vertex matrices. The following computes the solution of 500 random vertex
            linear systems and plots the result of first and second component into the figure.

%% DEMOINTLAB  A little demonstration of INTLAB, the Matlab toolbox for Reliable Computing
% by Siegfried M. Rump

%% Welcome to INTLAB, the Matlab toolbox for Reliable Computing 
% Following are some examples how to use INTLAB, the Matlab toolbox for Reliable Computing. 
% Since I like pictures, some features using the graphical capabilities of INTLAB are demonstrated.
% Please consult "demo intval" to get acquainted to define and use intervals. See also
% the other demos like gradient, hessian, long, polynom, etc.
%
%% Possible overestimation by interval operations
% As a first example watch possible overestimation by interval operations. 
% Define a 2 x 2 rotation matrix Q rotating by 30 degrees and consider the
% two-dimensional box X with lower left vertex (1,1) and upper right vertex

format compact short infsup

phi = 30*pi/180;
Q = [ cos(phi) -sin(phi) ; sin(phi) cos(phi) ]

X = [ infsup(1,2) ; infsup(2,4) ]
 
 
%% The product Q*X: rotation of an interval
% Distinguish between the power set operation Q*X and the interval operation Q*X.
% By linearity, the power set result is an n-dimensional parallelogram. The interval
% product Q*X, however, must be an interval vector. By definition, it is the smallest interval
% vector containg all possible Q*x for x in X. In blue is the interval result
% of Q*X, while in red is the true range of Q*x for x in X.
 
Y = Q*X
plotintval(Y), hold on
x = [1 1 2 2;2 4 2 4]; y = Q*x;
index = convhull(y(1,:),y(2,:));
plot(0,0,'o')
plot(x(1,index),x(2,index),'kREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH')
plot(y(1,index),y(2,index),'r-o')
axis equal
hold off
 
%% Another example of interval overestimation: complex multiplication
% It is the principle of interval operations that they always produce a result which
% contains all possible results of operations between operands in the input operands.
% Another example of overestimation is complex multiplication. The data for the following
% picture is taken from Markus Grimmer, Wuppertal, presented at the Dagstuhl meeting on 
% "Numerical Software with Result Verification", January 2003. The blue circle is the
% (complex) interval result. Real intervals in INTLAB use inf-sup representation, while
% complex intervals use mid-rad representation.
%
 
kmax = 40; i = sqrt(-1); a=midrad(1,1); b=midrad(-1+i,1); 
plotintval(a*b); hold on
phi = linspace(0,2*pi,kmax);
[A,B] = meshgrid( mid(a)+rad(a)*exp(i*phi) , mid(b)+rad(b)*exp(i*phi) );
plot(A.*B)
hold off
 
%% A model problem for global optimization proposed by Griewank
% The amount of overestimation depends on many things, especially on the formulation of
% a function. As a rule thumb one might say that to diminish overestimation, a single
% variable should not occur too many times. However, there are many counterexamples
% to that. 
%
% Sometimes there is not much overestimation. As an example take the following well known
% test function for global optimization routines proposed by Griewank:
 
f = inline(' (x.^2+y.^2)/4000 + cos(x).*cos(y)/sqrt(2) + 1 ')
 
%% Find the minimum function value, kmax = 20
% The task for a global optimizer is to find the minimum function value for 
%    -60 <= x <= 60
%    -60 <= y <= 60
% To get an impression of the function we first take a look at a plot. The following is
% how it really happened to me.
 
kmax = 20;
[x,y] = meshgrid(linspace(-60,60,kmax));
surf(x,y,f(x,y))

%%  Find the minimum function value, kmax = 50
% The surface looks smooth and one might argue why should this be a serious 
% test function for global optimization. However, if we repeat the plot with 
% 50 meshpoints in x- and
% y-direction, then the function decovers its ugly behaviour.
 
kmax = 50;
[x,y] = meshgrid(linspace(-60,60,kmax));
surf(x,y,f(x,y))
 
%% Estimation of the range of the Griewank-function over the whole domain by taking the minimum and maximum in the nodes
% The first plot looks nice just because of advantageous plotting nodes. 
% We may try to estimate the range of the function over the whole domain
% by taking the minimum and maximum in the nodes. This is, by construction,
% always an inner inclusion. 
 
min(min(f(x,y))), max(max(f(x,y)))

%% Inclusion of the range by interval arithmetic
% A true inclusion is easily obtained by interval arithmetic.
%
% Note that the first estimate required 50*50 = 2500 function evaluation, whereas
% the validated inclusion requires only one interval evaluation. A closer inspection
% shows that the interval bounds are sharp up to two digits,
% so in this case there is not much overestimation. Unfortunately, this is not always typical.

X = infsup(-60,60); Y = X; f(X,Y)
 
%% A linear system in n=50 unknowns with random entries A_ij
% For a given linear system with data afflicted with tolerances one may want to 
% compute the smallest box around the set of all solution for data varying within
% the tolerances. A common approach for that is Monte Carlo analysis. 
% 
% Consider a randomly generated linear system with interval matrix A and right hand side b
% such that  A.mid * x = b  for x = ones(n,1). The following generates such a linear system
% in n=50 unknowns with random entries A_ij uniformly distributed within [-0.5,0.5] and
% each A_ij afflicted with a relative tolerance of 1e-5. 
 
n = 50; rand('state',0)
A = rand(n)-.5; A = midrad(A,1e-5*abs(A)); b = A.mid*ones(n,1);
c = cond(A.mid)
 
%% Inclusion interval vector X of solution of the interval linear system Ax=b
% The condition number c~1e2 suggests that we may expect a variation of the solution
% of the order c*1e-5 ~ 1e-3. 
%
% The following computes an inclusion X of the solution set of the 
% interval linear system Ax=b, that is for every C in A the true solution of Cx=b is in X.
% The interval box of the first two components X(1) versus X(2) is plotted.
 
X = verifylss(A,b); 
plotintval(X(1:2)), hold on
 
%% Try a Monte Carlo approach
% The size of the box is of the expected order, but is it an overestimation? Note that we 
% know the expected size of X only because we computed the condition number of the (midpoint)
% matrix. 
% 
% We may try a Monte Carlo approach. In order to obtain large variations of the solution
% we randomly choose only "vertex" matrices, that is matrices C such that C_ij is equal to A_ij.inf 
% or A_ij.sup. We solve  n  such linear systems and plot the first two 
% components of the result into the computed inclusion. 
%
% Note that this approach took of the order of n^4 operations. The random points suggest
% that the computed inclusion is quite an overestimation of the true range of the first
% two components. 
% 
 
for i=1:n
  a = A.mid+(rand(size(A))>.5).*rad(A); 
  x = a\b; 
  plot(x(1),x(2),'o');
end
 
%% Use sign information of an approximate inverse of A.mid to obtain the true range
% However, we may use sign information of an approximate inverse of A.mid to approximate
% extreme points of the true range of the solution. We do this for 
% four linear systems, and the result is plotted into our figure by a circle 'o'.
 
R = inv(A.mid);
for i=1:2
  for s=[-1 1]
    a = A.mid - s*(sign(R(i,:)')*ones(1,n)).*A.rad;
    x = a\b;
    plot(x(1),x(2),'o')
  end
end
 
%% Solution of 500 random vertex linear systems
% These four carefully choosen 'vertex' matrices show that the computed inclusion is 
% indeed sharp! We mention that it does not help very much to increase the number of
% random vertex matrices. The following computes the solution of 500 random vertex
% linear systems and plots the result of first and second component into the figure.
 
for i=1:500
  a = A.mid+(rand(size(A))>.5).*rad(A); 
  x = a\b; 
  plot(x(1),x(2),'o');
end
hold off

%% Solution of n  vertex linear systems
% As expected such an approach does not help very much. Note that we solved 500 linear
% systems of dimension 50. 
%
% The observed behaviour is not untypical. If we do the same for other components of the
% solution, for example the 13th and 38th, say, and solve again  n  vertex linear systems
% the result is as follows.
 
i1 = 13; i2 = 38;
plotintval(X([i1 i2])), hold on
for i=1:n
  a = A.mid+(rand(size(A))>.5).*rad(A); 
  x = a\b; 
  plot(x(i1),x(i2),'o');
end
for i=[i1 i2]
  for s=[-1 1]
    a = A.mid - s*(sign(R(i,:)')*ones(1,n)).*A.rad;
    x = a\b;
    plot(x(i1),x(i2),'o')
  end
end
hold off

%% Roots of the polynomial in the complex plane
% Consider the following polynomial of degree 20 with randomly generated coefficients
% uniformly distributed in [-1,1]. We plot the roots of the polynomial in the complex plane.
 
n = 20, rand('state',0)
P = randpoly(n)
r = roots(P); plot(real(r),imag(r),'o')

%% Calculate the range of P in the interval [-1,.7]
% The roots are not too far from the unit circle, as expected.
%
% Suppose we wish to calculate the range of P in the real interval [-1,.7]. The easiest
% way is interval evaluation. We plot the polynomial and the inclusion of the range
% computed by (naive) interval arithmetic.
%
 
a = -1; b = .7; 
X = infsup(a,b); 
Y = P{X}
plotpoly(P,a,b)
hold on

%% Bernstein coefficients
%
% Obviously, the computed inclusion Y is a true inclusion of the range, but an overestimation.
% We can improve using Bernstein coefficients. 
%
% Bernstein coefficients are computed with respect to the defining interval [0,1]. If we
% transform [a,b] into that interval and compute the Bernstein coefficients, then plot
% the convex hull of the latter are an inclusion of the range of the polynomial. 
  
B = bernsteincoeff(ptrans(P,a,b,0,1)); 
plotbernstein(B,a,b)
hold off

%% Improvement of Bernstein bounds
% The green line is the convex hull of the Bernstein coefficients. The upper bound is
% sharp, but the lower bound is still improvable. We may do so by splitting the interval
% into two parts, for example into [-1,-.2] and [-.2 .7], and transform both into [-1,1],
% one after the other.
 
plotpoly(P,a,b), hold on
a = -1; b = -.2; 
B = bernsteincoeff(ptrans(P,a,b,0,1)); 
plotbernstein(B,a,b), 
a = -.2; b = .7; 
B = bernsteincoeff(ptrans(P,a,b,0,1)); 
plotbernstein(B,a,b), hold off

%% Bernstein coefficients for interval polynomials
% Bernstein coefficients may be computed for interval polynomials as well. Following is an
% example plotted in the interval [-1,2]. The blue and read lines are the lower and upper
% bound of the interval polynomial, respectively, and the green lines form the Bernstein bounds.
 
P = polynom([infsup(1,2) infsup(-4,2) infsup(-3,1)])
 
a = -1; b = 2;
plotpoly(P,a,b), hold on
 
B = bernsteincoeff(ptrans(P,a,b,0,1)); 
plotbernstein(B,a,b)
hold off
 
%% The solution complex of a linear interval system
% The solution complex of a linear interval system is known to be convex in every orthant. 
% Here is a simple example.
  
A = [infsup(2,4) infsup(-1,0);infsup(0,1) infsup(1,2)]; 
b = [infsup(-2,5);1];
plotlinsol(A,b)
 
%% Convexity of the solution set of an interval linear system
% At first sight this looks like a contradiction. However, when plotting the axes, convexity
% in every orthant becomes clear.
 
plotlinsol(A,b,1)

%% A batman like example
% Some solution sets have nice shapes. Following is a batman-like example.
 
A = [infsup(2,4) infsup(-1,1);infsup(-1,1) infsup(2,4)]
b = [infsup(-3,3);.8],
plotlinsol(A,b)
