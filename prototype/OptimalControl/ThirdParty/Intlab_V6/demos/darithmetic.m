%% DEMOARITHMETIC  Interval arithmetic in INTLAB
%

%% Redefinition of the interval arithmetic
% With Version 6 of INTLAB I redefined the interval arithmetic in INTLAB. Formerly,
% the empty set was represented by NaN. It turned out that a consistent definition
% of all interval operations avoiding NaN-results slows down EVERY interval operation
% in INTLAB. Therefore I choose to interpret a NaN-component as "no information".
%
% Although infinity- or NaN-components are usually rare, taking care of them slows
% down simply the addition by up to a factor 3. I found this hardly acceptable.
%
% Most users won't recognize any change. I recommend to visit 
%
%    " DEMOINTVAL  Interval operations in INTLAB "
%
% first before continuing with this demo.                  

%% Definition of interval arithmetic
% An interval component with value NaN is not empty but no information is available
% on that component. For example,

     format compact short infsup
     X = [ infsup(3,inf) ; infsup(-1,2) ]
     X0 = 0 * X
     
%% 
% has one component "NaN" due to the multiplication 0*inf. Any operation with this
% component will result in a "NaN" component, such as

     contains_0 = in(0,X0)
     intersect( infsup(-1,4) , X0 )

%% Input out of range for real standard functions
% If for real standard functions part of the input is out of range, the result
% of the corresponding component will be NaN:

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnNaN')
     X = [ infsup(-2,9) ; infsup(0,4) ]
     Y = sqrt(X)

%%
% This is the default. However, one may choose to ignore input out of range. In this case
% a flag will be set:
     
     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnIgnore')
     X = [ infsup(-2,9) ; infsup(0,4) ]
     Y = sqrt(X)
     exception = intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnOccurred')

%% Why is a flag necessary?
% In a number of applications it is useful to ignore input out of range. Although this
% definition is nice and clean, it needs some care. Mathematical assertions may only be
% true if no input out-of-range appeared during the calculation:
% A number of verification methods use Brouwer's fixed point theorem. It says that a
% continuous self-mapping of a non-empty, compact and convex subset of the R^n has a fixed point.
% Consider
%
%    f(x) = sqrt(x) - 1 .
%
%%     
% There is no real x with f(x)=x. Ignoring input out of range, we obtain 

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnIgnore')
     X = infsup(-2,9)
     Y = sqrt(X)-1
          
%%
% and Y is contained in X, pretending f(X) is contained in X. No error message occurred. Hence 
% we might conclude that f has a fixed point in X. 

%%
% For a safe
% mathematical assertion, Y in X is not enough: We also need to check that X is non-empty
% and no input out-of-range occurred. Since the latter may have happened anywhere in a 
% complicated computation, an out-of-range flag is mandatory.
%
% Note that the flag is set independent of the mode. Checking the flag resets the flag.

%% Why two modes?
% A casual user may forget to check the out-of-range flag (or might not even know of it). 
% Therefore I found it necessary to define a safe default mode. This is the NaN-mode.
% Any operation with NaN produces a NaN. Also a NaN can never be enclosed in some
% interval, hence in(Y,X) is false in the example above. 

%% How to use the NaN-mode?
% The default NaN-mode can be used without any precautions. If during the computation of
% a result all operations are well-defined, the computed result is a true inclusion of the
% correct result.
%
% If during the computation the input of some operation was out-of-range, the computed
% result will be NaN. More precisely, the corresponding components will be NaN, as in

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnNaN')
     X = intval(-1:1)
     Y = log(X)
     
%% How to use the ignore-mode?
% First switch to the ignore-mode and reset the out-of-range flag.

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnIgnore')
     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnOccurred');
  
%%     
% If during a computation some input was out of range and therefore ignored, the flag will be set.
% For example,

     format _
     X = intval(1:2:5)
     Y = X-2
     flag1 = intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnOccurred')
     Z = asin(Y)
     flag2 = intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnOccurred')
     
%%     
% If the flag is not set, then no out-of-range operation occurred in the whole computation.
% Again note that the flag is set both in the NaN- and the ignore-mode. For example,

     format infsup
     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnNaN')
     flag1 = intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnOccurred')
     X = midrad( -1:1 , 5e-5 )
     Y = log(X)
     flag2 = intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnOccurred')


%% What is the difference between the two modes?
% In the NaN-mode, the default and safe mode, the _individual_ interval components carry
% the information whether or not some input out-of-range was ignored. 

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnNaN',0);
     X = [ infsup(2,3) infsup(-1,4) -2 ]
     sqrt(X)

%%
% In the ignore-mode, the expert mode, only the global information whether or not _somewhere_
% an input out-of-range occurred is available. However, the individual components show the
% result for all input inside-range.

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnIgnore',0);
     X = [ infsup(2,3) infsup(-1,4) -2 ]
     sqrt(X)
     flag = intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnOccurred')
     
%%
% Note, however, that real standard functions can be switched automatically to their complex
% pendant as follows:

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnWarn')
     X = [ infsup(2,3) infsup(-1,4) ]
     midrad(sqrt(X))
     flag = intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnOccurred')
     
%%
% The warning may be suppressed using "intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnAuto')".

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnAuto')
     X = [ infsup(2,3) infsup(-1,4) ]
     midrad(sqrt(X))
     flag = intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnOccurred')

%% Complex standard functions
% It seems difficult to find a consistent definition when to set the out-of-range flag
% for complex standard functions. In particular, how should it be interpreted when the
% input interval covers the branch cut, or is at its boundary. Therefore I choose not to
% set the out-of-range flag for complex standard functions, independent of the input.
     
%% The empty set
% In contrast to the ignore-mode, the empty set does not exist in the NaN-mode. This is a
% necessary compromise. Since NaN is interpreted as Not-an-Interval, another representation
% of the empty set would have been necessary.
%
% However, the only operation in the NaN-mode, the result of which may be the empty
% set is intersection. However, numerous case distinctions in many programs would have
% been necessary to distinguish between NaN and the empty set - whatever the representation
% of the latter may be. All operations would be slowed down by that.
%
% I think this is not worth it. If in some application computations with the empty set are
% important, please use the ignore-mode.
