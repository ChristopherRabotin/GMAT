%NEWTON       Function value and Jacobian for Newton iteration
%
% For gradient variable y, the sizes of y.x and y.dx are adapted to be
% suitable for Newton iteration.
% After execution, the value of  fy = y.x  and  J = y.dx  are
% in vector and matrix form such that  J\fy is the Newton correction.
% For a given approximate value xs, a Newton iteration is
%
%    ys = f(xs);
%    [ fy , J ] = newton(ys);
%    xs = xs - reshape( J\fy , size(xs));
