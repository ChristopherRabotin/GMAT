/**
 * A custom extension to the wxTree class
 * 
 * A wxWindows based Tree component that adds text data in columns on the right
 * side of the displayed tree.  This component has been built and tested under 
 * wxWindows 2.4.2, running on Windows XP, Linux (RedHat 8, 2.4.20 kernel), and
 * MacIntosh OSX 10.2.  The current list of bugs and enhancements is provided 
 * below.
 *
 * @todo The current form of the DecoratedTree class does not provide methods 
 * to rework the tree after it is built.  This means the tree "decorations" on
 * the right don't get repopulated when the wxTree base changes.
 * 
 * @bug  Adding a decoration string with an index that has not been populated 
 *       results in a segmenttion fault.  The vector should be checked and 
 *       resized if needed when the decoration string is added.
 * 
 * @bug  The indices of the decoration strings is not very intuitive.  Strings
 *       are numbered right to left, top to bottom.
 * 
 * @bug  Under Linux, the box drawing for the component doesn't expand and 
 *       contract correctly in this version of the DecoratedTree.  (It was 
 *       working before, so it just needs a careful walkthrough...)
