/**
 * Base class for Adaptive Runge-Kutta integrators
 *
 *  The Runge-Kutta integration scheme is a single step method used to solve
 *  differential equations for \f$n\f$ coupled variables of the form
 *
 *  \f[{{dr^i}\over{dt}} = f(t,r)\f]
 *
 *  (The superscript in this discussion refers to the variables; hence \f$f^i\f$
 *  is the \f$i^{th}\f$ variable, and \f$r^{(n)}\f$ refers to all \f$n\f$
 *  variables.)  The method takes an integration step, \f$h\f$, by breaking the
 *  interval into several stages (usually of smaller size) and calculating
 *  estimates of the integration result at each stage.  The later stages use the
 *  results of the earlier stages.  The cumulative effect of the integration is
 *  an approximate total step \f$\delta t\f$, accurate to a given order in the
 *  series expansion of the differential equation, for the state variables
 *  \f$r_i(t+\delta t)\f$ given the state \f$r_i(t)\f$.
 *
 *  The time increment for a given stage is given as a multiple \f$a_i\f$ of the
 *  total time step desired; thus for the \f$i^{th}\f$ stage the interval used
 *  for the calculation is \f$a_i \delta t\f$; the estimate of the integrated
 *  state at this stage is given by
 *
 *  \f[ k_i^{(n)} = \delta t f(t+a_i\delta t, r^{(n)}(t) +
 *                  \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}b_{ij}k_j^{(n)}) \f]
 *
 *  where \f$b_{ij}\f$ contains a set of coefficients specific to the Runge-Kutta
 *  instance being calculated.  Given the results of the stage calculations, the
 *  total integration step can be calculated using another set of coefficients,
 *  \f$c_j\f$ and the formula
 *
 *  \f[ r^{(n)}(t+\delta t) = r^{(n)}(t) + \sum_{j=1}^{stages}c_j k_j^{(n)} \f]
 *
 *  The error control for these propagators is implemented by comparing the
 *  results of two different orders of integration.  The difference between the
 *  two steps provides an estimate of the accuracy of the step; a second set of
 *  coefficients corresponding to this second integration scheme can be used to
 *  obtain a solution
 *
 *  \f[r'^{(n)}(t+\delta t) = r^{(n)}(t) + \sum_{j=1}^{stages}c_j^* k_j^{*(n)}\f]
 *
 *  With care, the stage estimates \f$k_j\f$ and \f$k_j^*\f$ can be selected so
 *  that they are the same; in that case, the estimate of the error in the
 *  integration \f$\Delta^{(n)}\f$ can be written
 *
 *  \f[ \Delta^{(n)} =
 *                  \left| \sum_{j=1}^{stages}(c_j - c_j^*) k_j^{(n)} \right| \f]
 *
 *  (The difference between the coefficients \f$c_j - c_j^*\f$ is the array of
 *  error estimate coefficients (ee) in this code.)
 *
 *  Once the estimated error has been calculated, the size of the integration
 *  step can be adapted to a size more appropriate to the desired accuracy of the
 *  integration.  If the step results in a solution that is not accurate enough,
 *  the step needs to be recalculated with a smaller step size.  Labeling the
 *  desired accuracy \f$\alpha\f$ and the obtained accuracy \f$\epsilon\f$
 *  (calculated, for instance, as the largest element of the array \f$\Delta\f$),
 *  the new step used by the Runge-Kutta integrator is
 *
 *  \f[\delta t_{new}=
 *             \sigma\delta t\left({{\alpha}\over{\epsilon}}\right)^{1/(m-1)}\f]
 *
 *  where \f$m\f$ is the order of truncation of the series expansion of the
 *  differential equations being solved.  The factor \f$\sigma\f$ is a safety
 *  factor incorporated into the calculation to avoid unnecessary iteration over
 *  attempted steps.  Common practice is to set this factor to 0.9; that is the
 *  default value used in this implementation.
 *
 *  Similarly, if the step taken does not result in the desired accuracy, you may
 *  want to increase the step size parameter for the next integration step.  The
 *  new estimate for the desired stepsize is given by
 *
 *  \f[\delta t_{new}=
 *             \sigma\delta t\left({{\alpha}\over{\epsilon}}\right)^{1/(m)}\f]
 *
 *  Sometimes you do not want to increase the stepsize in this manner; for example,
 *  you may want to keep the maximum step taken at some fixed value.  This
 *  implementation provides a mechanism for specifying a maximum allowed step.
 *
 *  Sometimes it is convenient to request steps of a specified size, regardless
 *  of the stepsize control algorithm or the calculation of the "best step"
 *  described above.  This implementation accomplishes that task by taking
 *  multiple error controlled steps is necessary to step across the requested
 *  interval.
 *
 *  Both of these features are implemented using the boolean flags described in
 *  the base class for the integrators.  See the documentation for the Integrator
 *  class for more information about these flags.
