/**
 * The DynamicLibrary class defines the interfaces that are needed to build a
 * GMAT plug-in library.  GMAT plugins usually include one or more classes
 * derived from GmatBase, one or more factories that create instances of these
 * classes, and three C-style functions that are accessed to import the Factory
 * into GMAT.  The functions required in the plugin library are defined as
 * follows:
 *
 *    Integer     GetFactoryCount();
 *    Factory*    GetFactoryPointer(Integer index);
 *    void        SetMessageReceiver(MessageReceiver* mr);
 *
 * The use of the first two functions matches the calls defined for this class.
 * The MessageReceiver is set using the SetMessageReceiver function when the
 * library is loaded into memory.
 *
 * Plugin libraries may also optionally create and use TriggerManagers.  A
 * TriggerManager is an engine-level component that exists at the scope of the
 * Sandbox.  Each unique TriggerManager is a singleton in the Sandbox, and is
 * used to trigger specific Mission Control Sequence actions during a run.  The
 * prototypical TriggerManager option is event location for shadow entry and
 * exit epoch calculations during a run.
 *
 * Plugin libraries that include TriggerManagers need to implement the following
 * two functions:
 *
 *    Integer           GetTriggerManagerCount();
 *    TriggerManager*   GetTriggerManager(Integer index);
 *
 * If these functions are not implemented, the library will load but no
 * TriggerManager will be loaded.  In other words, if your code does not need a
 * TriggerManager, there is no need to implement these functions.
 *
 * Plugin libraries that include resources that should appear on a ResourceTree
 * should implement the following function:
 *
 *    Integer               GetMenuEntryCount();
 *    Gmat::PluginResource* GetMenuEntry(Integer index);
 *
 * The parameter, index, for the 2nd function is the index of the new entry that
 * should be placed to the tree.  Factories that supply resources that already
 * have tree nodes should not implement this method; it is used to register
 * new types of objects with the resource tree.
 *
 * The PluginResource returned from this function provides four pieces of
 * information used to manage objects in the user interface:
 *
 *      std::string nodeName;         // Identifier for the resource
 *      std::string parentNodeName;   // Optional owning type identifier
 *      UnsignedInt type;             // Core type
 *      std::string subtype;          // Optional subtype off of the core
 *
 * The nodeName and type enumeration are required parameters.  If the new tree
 * node should appear at the resource level in the tree, the parentNodeName
 * should be set to the empty string.  If the new node should appear as a
 * subnode of an existing node, the name of the existing node should be set in
 * the parentNodeName string.  If the new object type is derived from an
 * extendible object type, the subtype name is passed in in the subtype field.
 * For example, GMAT has two subtypes of built in Solvers as of this writing:
 * Boundary Value Solvers and Optimizers.  If a new type of solver is added
 * through a plugin, the scripted subtype parameter is set in the subtype
 * field.  So, for example, a simulator subtype would set this field to the
 * string "Simulator".  The subtype field should be set to the empty string if
 * it is not needed.
 *
 * If these functions are not implemented, the library will load but no
 * ResourceTree updates will be loaded.  In other words, if your code does not
 * need any new ResourceTree items, there is no need to implement these
 * functions.
 *
 * Finally, plugins that implement GUI controls (panels, dialog boxes, etc)
 * should implement the following functions:
 *
 *    std::string GetGuiToolkitName();
 *    Integer GetGuiFactoryCount();
 *    GuiFactory* GetGuiFactory();
 *
 * The first method here, GetGuiToolkitName, returns a string identifying the
 * toolkit used for the GUI components.  Normal usage in GMAT would be to return
 * "wxWidgets" from this call.  Some third party groups may want to use this
 * structure to support other toolkits.  The design here is intended to allow
 * such extensions.
