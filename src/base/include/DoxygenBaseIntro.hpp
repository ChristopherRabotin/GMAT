/**
 * \mainpage GMAT Base Code Overview
 *
 * This documentation provides a description of the contents of the core engine
 * code for the General Mission Analysis Tool, GMAT.
 *
 * GMAT's engine is built into a shared library that provides all of the core
 * functionality of the system, as described in the opening chapters to the GMAT
 * Architectural Specification.  This library, libGmatBase, contains the
 * classes,structures, and other elements described in that documentation.
 * Interested readers should review the Architectural Specification to gain an
 * understanding of how the components described in this documentation behave.
 *
 * The documentation presented here describes the low level structures and data
 * elements of GMAT's classes and functions contained in the engine and the core
 * user configured elements comprising the resources and mission control
 * sequence.  By studying this documentation, you can learn how GMAT's classes
 * work and interact to accomplish mission modeling tasks.  Programmers that
 * want to extend GMAT's functionality should read this documentation while
 * writing their own classes derived from the GMAT code so that they can ensure
 * that derived elements used in custom code conforms to GMAT's interfaces.
 *
 * This documentation comprises the application programming interface (API) for
 * the components of the core GMAT system.  Every member of all classes in
 * GMAT's base code has an entry in this documentation, along with the
 * documentation extracted from the code.  The documentation in the code
 * conforms to the needs of the Doxygen open source documentation system.  This
 * conformity is enforced through the GMAT coding standards, as described in the
 * GMAT Style Guide.
 *
 * The wxWidgets based GMAT graphical user interface (GUI) is documented in a
 * separate set of pages.
