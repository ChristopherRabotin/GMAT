/**
 * Definition of the SpiceOrbitKernelWriter, which writes SPICE data (kernel) files.
 * This class calls the JPL-supplied CSPICE routines to write the specified
 * SPICE file.  Currently, this class write SPK files of Data Type 13 (Hermite
 * Interpolation with Unequal time steps; geometric - no aberration).  Currently,
 * each SPK file written by GMAT contains data for one and only one object
 * (currently only spacecraft objects are handled).
 *
 * Calling code must create a SpiceOrbitKernelWriter for each file that is to be
 * written.
 *
 * The output SPK file name takes the form
 *       <objName>-<yyyymmdd>-<data-type>-<n>.bsp
 * where <objName>  is the name of the object for which the SPK file is created
 *       <yyyymmdd> is the date of file creation
 *       <data-type>is the two-digit identifier for the SPK data type (see
 *                  SPK documentation at NAIF website)
 *       <n>        is the incremental file counter
 *       .bsp       is the standard file extension for binary SPK files
 *
 * This code creates a temporary text file, required in order to include META-Data
 * (commentary) in the SPK file.  The file is deleted from the system after the
 * commentary is added to the SPK file.  The name of this temporary text file
 * takes the form
 *       GMATtmpSPKcmmnt<objName>.txt
 * where <objName>  is the name of the object for which the SPK file is created
 *
