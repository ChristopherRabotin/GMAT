This file describes the steps you need to take to get GMAT set to run from the 
bin folder.  

The GMAT repository is set up to build GMAT's executable applications and place
them in the top level bin folder.  The applications will not run without some 
additional files.  Those files are platform specific, so they are omitted from 
the GMAT repository, but are available from GMAT's SourceForge downloads.  Here 
are the steps you need to take to use them:

1. Download the environment data file archive from SourceForge 
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=201258)

2. Unpack the downloaded archive into a new folder.  This will give you a
subfolder named "gmat" that contains folders named "files" and "matlab", along 
with a few data files that can be ignored for now.

3. Copy the "files" and (if you use MATLAB) "matlab" folders into the bin folder
in the GMAT tree.

4. Copy the file named "gmat_startup_file.txt" from the build subfolder for your 
platform into the bin folder.

Once you have completed these steps, GMAT executables built from source can be 
run in the bin directory.
