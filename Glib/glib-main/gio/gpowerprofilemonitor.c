/**

 * @short_description: Power profile monitor
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * #GPowerProfileMonitor makes it possible for applications as well as OS components
 * to monitor system power profiles and act upon them. It currently only exports
 * whether the system is in “Power Saver” mode (known as “Low Power” mode on
 * some systems).
 *
 * When in “Low Power” mode, it is recommended that applications:
 * - disable automatic downloads;
 * - reduce the rate of refresh from online sources such as calendar or
 *   email synchronisation;
 * - reduce the use of expensive visual effects.
 *
 * It is also likely that OS components providing services to applications will
 * lower their own background activity, for the sake of the system.
 *
 * There are a variety of tools that exist for power consumption analysis, but those
 * usually depend on the OS and hardware used. On Linux, one could use `upower` to
 * monitor the battery discharge rate, `powertop` to check on the background activity
 * or activity at all), `sysprof` to inspect CPU usage, and `intel_gpu_time` to
 * profile GPU usage.
 *
 * Don't forget to disconnect the #GPowerProfileMonitor::notify::power-saver-enabled
 * signal, and unref the #GPowerProfileMonitor itself when exiting.
 *
 * Since: 2.70
