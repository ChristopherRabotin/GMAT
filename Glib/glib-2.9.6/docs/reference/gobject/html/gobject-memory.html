<p>
	The memory-management API for GObjects is a bit complicated but the idea behind it
	is pretty simple: the goal is to provide a flexible model based on reference counting
	which can be integrated in applications which use or require different memory management
	models (such as garbage collection, aso...). The methods which are used to
	manipulate this reference count are described below.

	  The functions <code class="function"><a href="gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html#g-object-ref">g_object_ref</a></code>/<code class="function"><a href="gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html#g-object-unref">g_object_unref</a></code> respectively 
	  increase and decrease the reference count. None of these function is thread-safe.
	  The reference count is, unsurprisingly, initialized to one by 
	  <code class="function"><a href="gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html#g-object-new">g_object_new</a></code> which means that the caller
          is currenly the sole owner of the newly-created reference.
          When the reference count reaches zero, that is, 
	  when <code class="function"><a href="gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html#g-object-unref">g_object_unref</a></code> is called by the last client holding
	  a reference to the object, the <span class="emphasis"><em>dispose</em></span> and the 
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>finalize</em></span> class methods are invoked.
	</p>
<p>
	  Finally, after <span class="emphasis"><em>finalize</em></span> is invoked, 
	  <code class="function"><a href="gobject-Type-Information.html#g-type-free-instance">g_type_free_instance</a></code> is called to free the object instance.
	  Depending on the memory allocation policy decided when the type was registered (through
	  one of the <code class="function">g_type_register_*</code> functions), the object's instance 
	  memory will be freed or returned to the object pool for this type.
	  Once the object has been freed, if it was the last instance of the type, the type's class
	  will be destroyed as described in <a href="gtype-instantiable-classed.html" title="Instantiable classed types: objects">the section called &#8220;Instantiable classed types: objects&#8221;</a> and 
	    <a href="gtype-non-instantiable-classed.html" title="Non-instantiable classed types: Interfaces.">the section called &#8220;Non-instantiable classed types: Interfaces.&#8221;</a>.

<p>
	Weak References are used to monitor object finalization: 
	<code class="function"><a href="gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html#g-object-weak-ref">g_object_weak_ref</a></code> adds a monitoring callback which does
	not hold a reference to the object but which is invoked when the object runs 
	its dispose method. As such, each weak ref can be invoked more than once upon
	object finalization (since dispose can run more than once during object 
	finalization).
	</p>
<p>
	<code class="function"><a href="gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html#g-object-weak-unref">g_object_weak_unref</a></code> can be used to remove a monitoring
	callback from the object. 
      </p>
<p>
	Weak References are also used to implement <code class="function"><a href="gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html#g-object-add-weak-pointer">g_object_add_weak_pointer</a></code>
	and <code class="function"><a href="gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html#g-object-remove-weak-pointer">g_object_remove_weak_pointer</a></code>. These functions add a weak reference
	to the object they are applied to which makes sure to nullify the pointer given by the user
	when object is finalized.

<a name="gobject-memory-cycles"></a>Reference counts and cycles</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	Note: the following section was inspired by James Henstridge. I guess this means that 
	all praise and all curses will be directly forwarded to him.
      </p>
<p>
	GObject's memory management model was designed to be easily integrated in existing code
	using garbage collection. This is why the destruction process is split in two phases:
	the first phase, executed in the dispose handler is supposed to release all references
	to other member objects. The second phase, executed by the finalize handler is supposed
	to complete the object's destruction process. Object methods should be able to run
	without program error (that is, without segfault :) in-between the two phases.
      </p>
<p>
	This two-step destruction process is very useful to break reference counting cycles.
	While the detection of the cycles is up to the external code, once the cycles have been
	detected, the external code can invoke <code class="function">g_object_dispose</code> which 
	will indeed break any existing cycles since it will run the dispose handler associated
	to the object and thus release all references to other objects.
      </p>
<p>
	Attentive readers might now have understood one of the rules about the dispose handler
	we stated a bit sooner: the dispose handler can be invoked multiple times. Let's say we
	have a reference count cycle: object A references B which itself references object A.
	Let's say we have detected the cycle and we want to destroy the two objects. One way to 
	do this would be to invoke <code class="function">g_object_dispose</code> on one of the 
	objects.
      </p>
<p>
	If object A releases all its references to all objects, this means it releases its
	reference to object B. If object B was not owned by anyone else, this is its last
	reference count which means this last unref runs B's dispose handler which, in turn,
	releases B's reference on object A. If this is A's last reference count, this last 
	unref runs A's dispose handler which is running for the second time before
	A's finalize handler is invoked !
      </p>
<p>
	The above example, which might seem a bit contrived can really happen if your
	GObject's are being handled by language bindings. I would thus suggest the rules stated above
	for object destruction are closely followed. Otherwise, <span class="emphasis"><em>Bad Bad Things</em></span> 
	will happen.
