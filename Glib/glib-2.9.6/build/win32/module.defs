# The version macros define what versions of libraries to use.

# The version numbers are defined unconditionally. If you want to
# produce a newer version of one of these libraries, the new number
# should be defined in the specific project makefile _after_ including
# this file (or make.{mingw,msc}). These version numbers are used in
# the names of some import libraries. 

# Please note that there are two (or three) ways to build the GLib
# (and GTK+ etc) libraries on Win32: Either using the same
# auto*/configure mechanism to generate makefiles as on Unix, and
# libtool to handle DLL creation. This currently only works for gcc,
# and even then it is hellish to set up to work 100% correctly. For
# people using that, this file is totally irrelevant.

# Or, use hand-written makefiles, either for MSVC (these are called
# makefile.msc and maintained by Hans Breuer), or for gcc
# (makefile.mingw, by Tor Lillqvist). Only for GLib are the
# makefile.mingw files believed to be up-to-date, for other modules
# they have been left to rot after Tor started using the
# autoconfiscated way of building.

# The stuff here uses the same name for (import) libraries as on Unix,
# as libtool uses those, and the semi-official developer packages are
# built using libtool.
