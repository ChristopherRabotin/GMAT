GMAT uses a high level construct -- the Tracking System -- to manage the
interactions between measurement models, measurement corrections, participants,
and the measurement manager.  In one sense, a tracking system is a container
for measurements.  It provides the ability to group compatible measurement
models together for use during simulation or estimation.  The tracking system
model in GMAT extends this basic container paradigm to include global
properties in a single scripted location.  GMAT's tracking system model
includes a container for measurement correction models like tropospheric
and ionospheric correction models.  These corrections are applied to all
measurements in the tracking system, as is described in this chapter.
