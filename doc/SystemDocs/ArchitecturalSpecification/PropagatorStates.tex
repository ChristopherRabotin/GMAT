%\section{\label{section:MissionStateOverview}The Mission State}

% The current values of spacecraft data, the state transition matrix, and other elements that evolve
% in GMAT's model are held, in the propagation subsystem, in the mission state\footnote{Here -- and
% throughout this chapter -- the term ``mission state'' and the word ``state'' represent this
% collection of data elements, unless otherwise specified.  Other chapters in the architectural
% specification may use the word ``state'' for different purposes -- for example, the Solver classes
% all function through finite state machines, where the current location of the system in the
% solution process is assigned a specific status, called a state, and move from one of these
% enumerated stated to another as the solution process is executed.}.  GMAT's mission state can be
% further decomposed into static components, components that evolve through numerical integration,
% components that have analytic evolution operators, and components that are modeled over time using
% stochastic models.
%
% \section{Classes Supporting the Mission State}
%
% The mission state data is culled from the objects that make use of the data contained in the
%state,
% and passed into the elements that the propagators use to calculate the state evolution.  As an
% example, each Spacecraft object manages data representing the position and velocity of that
% particular Spacecraft.  When GMAT needs to model the motion of that spacecraft, it gathers the
% epoch and corresponding position and velocity information in a mission state, and passes that
% mission state to the evolution operator so that the motion associated with the change of epoch can
% be calculated.  A more complete example of this process is presented in
% Section~\ref{section:IntegratorExample}.

\section{The MissionState Class}

% The MissionState class plays two roles in GMAT.  It acts as a container class that takes pointers
% to the objects that supply state data, providing a central location for the state data for mission
% elements that use it.  It also supplies the accumulated state data to those elements in the form
% that they need in order to process it and take actions, and routes any resulting changes in state
% to the objects that receive those changes.
%
% The MissionState class collects data into vectors used by the propagators.  These vectors are
% constructed based on the needs of the propagator, and
%
% GMAT's Numerical Integrators

\subsection{Enumerations used in the MissionState}

The MissionState uses several enumerations used to identify propagation components efficiently.
This section describes each of these enumerations.

\paragraph{PropMode}  The PropMode enumeration identifies the type of propagation used with a given
set of state elements.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ANALYTIC\_PROP}
\item \textbf{INTEGRATE}
\item \textbf{PRECALCULATED\_PROP}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{ElementType}  The ElementType enumeration identifies the kind of component contained in
a PropVector

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CARTESIAN\_START}
\item \textbf{CARTESIAN}
\item \textbf{EQUINOCTIAL\_START}
\item \textbf{EQUINOCTIAL}
\item \textbf{STM\_START}
\item \textbf{STM}
\item \textbf{QUARTERNION\_START}
\item \textbf{QUARTERNION}
\item \textbf{MASS}
\item \textbf{USER\_DEFINED}
\item \textbf{UNKNOWN\_ELEMENT\_TYPE}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{MissionState Attributes}

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Real epoch} The epoch of the state data managed by the MissionState.  GMAT requires
that all such state data in a MissionState use the same epoch.
\item\textbf{ObjectArray dataSource} The vector of objects that are propagated
\item\textbf{std::vector<PropMode> propModes} The propagation mode for each object that is
propagated.
\item\textbf{Integer dimension} Total number of elements that are propagated
\item\textbf{PropVector thePropVector} The state data to be propagated
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{MissionState Methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{bool AddSource(GmatBase* src, PropMode mode, ElementType type, Integer elementId)}
Registers an object as a data provider with the MissionState.  The mode parameter identifies the
type of propagation desired: analytic, numerically integrated, or from an ephemeris source.  The
type parameter identified the kind of element that is propagated.  The elementId parameter is the ID
for the start of the data that is propagated.  All propagated data must be accessible using the
generic access methods defined for GmatBase objects, so that the elementId can be used to access
these data.
\item\textbf{bool Initialize()}  Performs preliminary setup of the PropVector prior to propagation.
\item \textbf{bool PrepareToPropagate()}  Completes pre-propagation setup.
\end{itemize}

\section{\label{section:propVector}The PropVector Class}

%The propVector component of the MissionState is a Real array of data sized to match the data vector
%needed by GMAT's numerical integrators for propagation.  The propVector is constructed by the
%MisisonState when the PrepareToPropagate methos if executed by the command that controls the
%propagation.  Figure~\ref{figure:PropVectorComponents} shows a representative layout for a
%propVector.

Figure~\ref{figure:PropVectorComponents} shows a representative layout of the data in a PropVector
for a single spacecraft.  The vector displayed here is the PropVector used by a numerical
integrator that is modeling the evolution of the spacecraft's trajectory, state transition matrix,
and attitude during a finite burn maneuver.  When a MissionState object assembles a PropVector, it
follows a set of ordering rules designed to make the data in the PropVector fall in a specific
order so that access from the propagators is simplified.  The general order, as shown in this
example, is to place trajectory data first in the vector, followed by associated matrices that
evolve along with the trajectory, then attitude data followed by associated attitde matrices, then
user defined elements, and finally transitory elements like mass, which only changes (through
propagation) during maneuvers.

\end{figure}

This ordering can be seen more explicitly in Figure~\ref{figure:ThreeSatPropVector}.  The
PropVector shown in this figure is a vector constructed for three spacecraft, where the mission
needs to propagate the trajectory, state transition matrix, and attitude for all three while
maneuvering all three simultaneously.

Spacecraft}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{figure:SelectPropVector} shown another example, where the propagation need not
integrate every element of all of the spacecraft.  In this example, the trajector is integrated for
all three spacecraft.  The state transition matrix is only propagated for the first and third
spacecraft, the attitude is propagated for the second, and the first spacecraft is depleting mass
during a maneuver.

Propagation}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{figure:AttitudePropVector} \textbf{This figure needs updating to include the second
PropVector for the trajectory piece} shows a mixed mode propagation, where the trajectory for our
three spacecraft is propagated using a precalculated, ephemeris based propagator and the attitude is
propagated numerically.
