Chapter~\ref{chapter:Spacecraft} described the structure of the core spacecraft model used in GMAT.
This chapter examines the components that can be used to extend the spacecraft model to include
models of hardware elements needed to model finite maneuvers and sensor measurements.

\section{The Hardware Class Structure}

\section{Finite Maneuver Elements}

\subsection{Fuel tanks}

\subsection{Thrusters}

\section{Sensor Modeling in GMAT}

GMAT does not contain sensor modeling capabilities at this time.  The Hardware class infrastructure
was designed to support sensor modeling at a later date.

\section{Six Degree of Freedom Model Considerations}
