GMAT's Solver classes may require one or more of several routine utility functions in order to
proceed towards the dictated solution.  These functions include calculation of gradients and
Jacobians, Hessians, and systematic searches in a specified direction (aka ``Line searches'') for
minima, and other routines common to the solver algorithms.  For each of these utilities, users can
provide their own implementation -- analytic or numerical -- or use an algorithm implemented in the
class.

This chapter describes the interfaces for these solver utilities and the implementation of the
algorithms internal to GMAT.  It also provides information about how user specified implementations
are used in GMAT.
