\chapauthor{Darrel J. Conway}{Thinking Systems, Inc.}

\section{Command Overview}

Users model the evolution of spacecraft over time in GMAT using a mission control sequence that
consists of a series of commands.  These commands are used to propagate the spacecraft, model
impulsive maneuvers, turn thrusters on and off, make decisions about how the mission should evolve,
tune parameters, and perform other tasks required to perform mission analysis.  This chapter
describes the core components of the system that implement this functionality.
Chapter~\ref{chapter:SpecificCommands} provides a more in depth examination of the specific commands
implemented in GMAT, providing details about the implementation of each.

\section{Structure of the Sequence}

The mission control sequence is designed to present users with a configurable, flexible mechanism
for controlling the GMAT model.  Commands may manipulate modeled components, control model
visualization and other output data, determine the order of subsequent operations through looping or
branching, tune parameters to meet mission criteria, or group commands together to be executed as a
single block.  Each GMAT Sandbox is assigned its own mission control sequence\footnote{While the
current implementation of GMAT has a single Sandbox, GMAT is designed to support multiple
sandboxes.}.  This design feature drives the late binding features of objects in the GMAT Sandbox
(see Section~\ref{section:SandboxLateBinding}), which, in turn, places demands for late binding
support on the GMAT commands.  The following paragraphs provide an overview of these features.
Implementation details are described later in the chapter.

\subsection{Command Categories}
GMAT commands can be broken into four distinct categories: ``Regular'' commands, Control
Logic commands, Solver commands, and Function commands, as described here.

\paragraph{Regular commands} are commands that perform a single, isolated operation and do not
depend on any other command to operate.  Examples of the regular command are the Propagate command
and the Maneuver command.  The regular commands can appear anywhere in the Mission Control Sequence.

\paragraph{Control Logic commands} are used to perform control flow operations in the Mission
Control Sequence.  Each control logic command controls a list of commands -- called the command
subsequence -- that is executed by the control logic command when that command determines that
execution is needed.  All control logic commands are paired with a matching End command.  The End
commands identify the end of the command subsequence controlled by the control logic command.

GMAT supports three control logic commands: If, While and For, which are paired with the commands
EndIf, EndWhile and EndFor.  For commands are used to iterate over the subsequence for a fixed
number of iterations.  If commands provide a mechanism to fork the Mission Control Sequence based on
conditions detected during execution.  While commands are used to iterate over the command
subsequence until some condition is met.

\paragraph{Solver commands} are similar to control logic commands in that they manage a command
subsequence and use that subsequence to explore how changes in parameters affect the results of
executing the subsequence.  GMAT has three classes of solver commands: Targeters, Optimizers, and
Iterators.  Targeters adjust parameters in order to meet a specific set of goals.  Optimizers also
adjust parameters, in order to find the set that optimizes a problem objective.  Iterators are used
to observe the results of changes to parameters, so that the statistical behavior or the solution
space of the subsequence can be measured and recorded.

One key difference between solver commands and control logic commands is that for the control logic
commands, the changes to the spacecraft and other mission components applied during a subsequence
run affect subsequent runs of the subsequence.  Solvers reset the spacecraft states from one
iteration to the next, so that the effect of changes to the input parameters are applied to the same
set of initial conditions from one iteration of the subsequence to the next.

\paragraph{Functions} are used in GMAT to generalize common tasks, to communicate with MATLAB, and
to encapsulate multistep tasks into a single call in a mission.  \textit{The function subsystem
design will be documented at a later date.}

\subsection{Command Sequence Structure}

The mission control sequence is implemented as a linked list of command objects.  The sequence is
constructed from a script by appending links to the list as they are constructed by the script
interpreter.  Commands that control subsequences build the subsequences by managing a child linked
list.  The child list is constructed by appending links until the related subsequence termination
command is encountered, terminating the subsequence list.

Users can also interact with the command sequence from the GMAT GUI; these interactions let users
append commands to the sequence, insert commands at intermediate points, and remove commands.  Users
view the sequence as a hierarchical tree, as shown in Figure \ref{figure:HierarchicalMissionTree}.
The mission is modeled by executing the commands in the linked list sequentially.  The mission tree
shown on the GUI provides a graphical view into the linked list, including the command subsequences
for commands that control subsequences.  The top node in the tree is the the first link in the list;
in the figure, that node is a Propagate command, labeled Propagate1 on the mission tree.  The entire
linked list consists of seven nodes: Propagate - Propagate - Target - Propagate - Propagate - Target
- Propagate.  Each of the target nodes controls a subsequence used in the targeting process.  The
first of these nodes is expanded in the figure to show the subsequence.  For this example, the
subsequence consists of five links: Vary - Maneuver - Propagate - Achieve - EndTarget.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Images/HierarchicalMissionTree.eps}
\caption{\label{figure:HierarchicalMissionTree}GMAT Command Sequence in the GUI}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Rework this piece -- it's not currently used} GMAT does not restrict the depth of the
nesting levels for the commands that control subsequences. The command classes include a counter
that monitors the current nesting level in the command sequence.  The nesting level is set when the
command is added to the linked list.  The main command sequence has a nesting level of 0.
Subsequences off of the main sequence increment the level to 1; subsequences contained in these
subsequences have a nesting level of 2, and so forth.  The subsequence termmination commands,
typically identified by an ``End'' prefix, have a nesting level set to the same level as the rest of
the subsequence, because they are the last command in the subsequence, and therefore exist at the
subsequence level.

\subsection{Command--Sandbox Interactions}

When a mission control sequence is run, all of the configured objects used in the run are copied
from the Configuration Manager into the Sandbox used for the run.  These copies are place into a
standard template library (STL) map matching the object names to pointers to the local copies in
the Sandbox.  These pointers need to be bound to the commands prior to execution of the mission
control sequence.  This late binding is performed during the initialization phase described below.
Additional details about the late bindign strategy implemented in GMAT can be found in
Section~\ref{section:SandboxLateBinding}.

During mission control sequence execution, the commands interact with the object copies to model
the interactions dictated for the model, as described in the execution section below.  These
interactions change the local copies, modeling the evolution of the system.  Once the command
sequence completes execution (either by finishing the sequence, encountering a ``Stop'' command, or
detecting a user generated stop event), each GMAT command is given the opportunity to complete any
pending operations.  This final step, described in the Finalization section below, is used to close
open file handles, clean up temporarily allocated memory, and perform any other housekeeping tasks
needed to maintain the mission control sequence for subsequent user actions.

\section{The Command Base Classes}

Figure~\ref{figure:CommandBaseClasses} shows core properties of the base classes used in the Command
subsystem.  The top level base class, GmatCommand, provides linked list interfaces and methods used
to parse command scripts.  BranchCommand adds capabilities to implement and execute commands that
run subsequences -- specifically, the Control Logic, Solver, and Function categories of commands.
Additional capabilities required by the Control Logic commands are provided by the ConditionalBranch
class.  Capabilities shared by all Solvers are implemented in the SolverBranchCommand class.

\section{Script Interfaces}

The standard script syntax for a command is the command name followed by zero or more text strings
separated by white space.  Commands that are scripted using this syntax are handled generically in
the Interpreter subsystem, as described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:ScriptRW}\footnote{Some commands
that do not follow this generic description are also handled in the Interpreters at this writing.}.
Commands that use more complex scripting than a simple list of elements manage their own parsing in
a customized implementation of the InterpretAction() method.  This section describes the command
base class structures and methods that are used by commands that override InterpretAction() and
parse their configurations internally.  Parsing for Commands that do not override the
InterpretAction() method is handled in the ScriptInterpreter.  The methods described in the
following text are not used by those Commands.

\subsection{\label{section:ParametersInCommands}Data Elements in Commands}

Commands can be scripted to describe the actions taken on elements of the model (i.e. objects
instantiating GMAT classes), or to manipulate specific data elements of these objects based on the
rules encoded into the command.  When performing the latter task, the specific data element is
accessed using an ElementWrapper helper object that can manipulate data represented by the
following types: numbers, object properties, variables, array elements, and Parameter objects.  In
addition, commands may be construsted in the future that operate on Array objects and strings; the
infrastructure needed for these objects is included in the wrapper enumerations, but not yet
implemented.

The data wrappers are described in Section~\ref{section:DataWrappers}\footnote{The ElementWrappers
use the Adapter design pattern, described in \ref{section:TheAdapterPattern}}. These wrappers are
designed to be used by commands when needed to handle single valued Real data elements in the
commands.  The Gmat namespace includes an enumeration, WrapperDataType, with entries for each of the
supported data types.  This enumeration is described in Section~\ref{section:WrapperDataTypeEnum}.
The data wrappers are used to standardize the interface to numbers, object properties, variables,
array elements, and other Parameter objects to perform the command operations. Arrays and Strings
are handled separately by the commands -- arrays, because they can have more than one value, and
strings, because they do not provide Real number data for use in the commands.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Images/CommandParsingandValidation.eps}
\caption[Calls Made to Build and Validate Commands]{\label{figure:CommandParsingFlow}Calls Made in
the Interpreters to Build and Validate Commands.  Specific calls to the command are prefaced on this
diagram with the C++ pointer notation, ``cmd->''.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{figure:CommandParsingFlow} shows an overview of the process used to build and validate
commands encountered in scripts and on the GUI.  The portions of the digram colored orange are
performed through calls launched by the ScriptInterpreter.  Commands created from the GUI follow the
procedure shown in purple.  In both cases, once the command has been built and the early binding
data has been set, the command is validated using methods provided by the Interpreter base class.
The calls made for this validation include calls that build the ElementWrapper members used in the
command.  These calls are shown in the figure in blue.

The process shown in Figure~\ref{figure:CommandParsingFlow} must be performed before the mission
control sequence can be executed in a Sandbox.  That includes identifying all of the names of
configured objects that the sequence will need, creation of any Parameters (performed in the
CheckUndefinedReference method) that will be required, and creation of the DataWrappers that will
need to be populated during Initialization in the Sandbox.

THe following subsections describe the support methods provided by the Interpreter and GUI
subsystems to configure the command objects.  These paragraphs are separated to match the three
sections of Figure~\ref{figure:CommandParsingFlow}.

\subsubsection{Scripted Command Configuration: Interpreter Support}

Scripted commands are configured using the Interpreter::CreateCommand method called from the
ScriptInterpreter while parsing a script.  The parsing process followed for commands is described
at a high level in Section~\ref{section:ParsingCommandBlocks}.  The Interpreter base class provides
several methods that facilitate that process, described here:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{GmatCommand* CreateCommand(const std::string \&type, const std::string \&desc, bool
\&retFlag, GmatCommand *inCmd = NULL)}:  The method that drives the command creation process for the
ScriptInterpreter.  This method takes the generating string for the command as found in the script,
and creates an instance of the corresponding GmatCommand object.  It then calls InterpretAction() on
the command; if that call fails, it calls the Interpreter's AssembleCommand method.  Finally, it
builds any wrappers needed by the command, and validates that referenced objects used in the command
have been created.
\item \textbf{bool AssembleCommand(GmatCommand *cmd, const std::string \&desc)}:  Commands that are
not internally parsed are configured in this method.
\end{itemize}

Once this step has been completed, the command has been created and strings have been set decribing
all objects and data wrappers referenced by the command.  The data wrappers are not yet created;
thaqt process is described after the next subsection.

\subsubsection{Command Configuration in the GUI}

The GMAT GUI configures commands directly, based on the entries made by a user on the GUI panel
corresponding to the command.  Commands are created when a user inserts them into the mission
control sequence, configured with default settings.  When a user opens the configuration panel,
makes changes, and then applies the changes using either the Apply of OK button, the panel calls an
internal method, ``SaveData'', which passes the data on the panel to the command object.

The data passed into the object identifies all of teh objects referenced by the command.  Commands
configured by the GUI typically get populated with valid descriptors; as we will see shortly, the
 validation is repeated after the data wrappers are built, as described in teh next section.  All
data that requires wrappers is passed into the command as an std::string, using the
SetStringParameter method. The command stores these data for use contructing the wrappers.

\subsubsection{Interpreter Support for Wrappers and Validation}

Once GMAT has completed the steps described above, the command is configured with strings
describing wrappers and referenced objects, along with any other command specific data needed to
fully configure the command.  The final steps used configuring the command are shown in blue on
Figure~\ref{figure:CommandParsingFlow}.  These steps are all encapsulated in the Interpreter method
ValidateCommand.  The methods in the Interpreter base class used for wrapper construction and
validation are provided here:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{void ValidateCommand(GmatCommand *cmd)}:  The method that executes the steps shown in
blue on the figure.  This method is called directly from the GUI, and as the final piece of
CreateCommand from the ScriptInterpreter.
\item \textbf{ElementWrapper* CreateElementWrapper(const std::string \&description)}:  This method
takes the descripion of a wrapper object and builds the corresponding wrapper.
\item \textbf{bool CheckUndefinedReference(GmatBase *obj, bool writeLine = true)}:  Method used to
verify that all referenced objects needed by the object (in this case, a Command) exist.  The
command is passed in as the first parameter.  The second parameter is a flag indicating if the line
number in the script should be written; for commands, that flag is left at its default true value.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{CreateElementWrapper}  Of these methods, the CreateElementWrapper bears additional
explanation.  The following steps are implemented in that method:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine if the string is a number.  If so, create a NumberWrapper, set its value, and
return the wrapper.
\item Check to see if there a parentheses pair in the string.  If so, perform the following actions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Check to see if the text preceding the opening paren is an array.  If not, throw an exception.
\item Create an ArrayElementWrapper, and set the array name to the text preceding the opening paren.
\item Separate text enclised in the parentheses into row and column strings.
\item Call CreateElementWrapper() for the row and column strings, and set the corresponding
wrappers and strings in the ArrayElementWrapper.
\item Return the wrapper.
\end{itemize}
\item Check to see if there a period in the string.  If so, the wrapper needs to be either an
ObjectPropertyWrapper or a ParameterWrapper.  Performs these steps to create the correct type:
\begin{itemize}
\item Break apart the string using the GmatStringUtil::ParseParameter method.
\item Find the owner object, and check to see if it has the type provided in the string.  If so,
create an ObjectPropertyWrapper, otherwise create a ParameterWrapper
\item Set the description string.
\end{itemize}
Return the resulting wrapper.
\item Check to see if the string describes a Variable.  If so, create a VariableWrapper, set the
description and value, and return the wrapper; otherwise, throw an exception\footnote{A later build
will detect and return NULL for Array or String objects, so that they can be handled when needed.}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Command Support for Parsing and Wrappers}

The command base class, GmatCommand, includes an instance of the TextParser described in
Section~\ref{section:TextParser}, along with an include statement for the GmatStringUtil namespace
definition (see Section~\ref{section:StringUtil} for details of the GmatStringUtil namespace).
These inclusions make all of the methods used for general purpose parsing of text from the
TextParser and the low level GmatStringUtil namespace functions available for use in command
parsing.  These elements are used by custom InterpretAction() methods when they are implemented for
the commands.

The base class also provides methods used during the creation and validation of the data wrappers.
These methods are used by the ScriptInterpreter, interacting with the Moderator in the
Interpreter::CreateCommand() method, to validate the objects required by the data wrappers.  The
methods supplied by the command base class to support data wrappers are described in
Section~\ref{section:CommandScriptingSupport}.  Before describing these methods, the wrapper
classes will be described.

\subsection{\label{section:DataWrappers}Data Type Wrapper
Classes\index{Wrappers}\index{Data Wrappers|see {Wrappers}}}

Many of the commands need to be able to treat all of the usable data types through a common
interface.  Table~\ref{table:ParameterInScriptExamples} presents representative examples to the
allowed data types in commands.  The data type interface used by the commands is captured in the
ElementWrapper class, shown with its subclasses in Figure~\ref{figure:CommandWrapperClasses}.
Derived classes are available for each of the supported types, using these classes:
NumberWrapper, ObjectPropertyWrapper, VariableWrapper, ArrayElementWrapper, and ParameterWrapper.
The Array class, when accessed as an entity rather than as a data provider for a single Real number,
is handled as a special case by any command designed to work with Array instances.  As indicated in
the table, no current command uses this capability, though it will be supported in the
NonlinearConstraint command in a future release of GMAT.  Similarly, strings are handled separately.

\begin{table}[tb]

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{6.3in}{|>{\raggedright\hspace{0pt}}p{1.1in}|>{\raggedright\hspace{0pt}}p{1.75in}

\tabularnewline \hline
Array & A & An entire array. Arrays are not yet supported in GMAT commands.  The
NonlinearConstraint command will be updated to use single column arrays (aka vectors) in a later
build.
\tabularnewline \hline

\tabularnewline \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Images/WrappersUsedbyCommands.eps}
\caption{\label{figure:CommandWrapperClasses}Parameter Wrappers Used by Commands}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The wrapper classes implement the following methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{std::string GetDescription()} Returns the current description string for the wrapper.
\item\textbf{void SetDescription(const std::string \&desc)} Sets the description string.
\item\textbf{const StringArray \&GetRefObjectNames()}: Returns a StringArray containing a list of
all reference objects used by the wrapper.
\item\textbf{bool SetRefObject(GmatBase *obj)}: Passes the a pointer to the reference object
into the wrapper so it can be assigned to the correct internal member.
\item\textbf{void SetupWrapper()}: Takes the description string and breaks it into components for
later use.
\end{itemize}

In addition, each ElementWrapper provides two abstract interfaces that can be used during command
execution:

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Real EvaluateReal()} is used to calculate the current value of the wrapped
object, returning a Real number when fired.
\item\textbf{bool SetReal(const Real value)} takes a Real number as input, and sets the wrapped
element to that value.  It returns a flag indicating success or failure of the data setting
operation.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The derived wrapper classes implement these methods (and override the other methods as
needed) to access the data structures corresponding to each data type.

\subsection{\label{section:CommandScriptingSupport}Command Scripting Support Methods}

The Interpreter subsystem provides the methods needed to construct the data wrapper classes and
pass the wrappers into the commands.  GmatCommand provides the following methods to support this
process:

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{void ClearWrappers()}: Deletes all current wrappers in preparation for a new set of
wrapper instances.
\item\textbf{const Stringarray \&GetWrappedObjectNameArray()}: Returns a list of all wrapper
descriptions so that the required wrappers can be constructed.
\item\textbf{bool SetElementWrapper(ElementWrapper *wrapper)}: Sends the wrapper into the command.
If the wrapper is set correctly, this method returns true.  If the description contained in the
wrapper does not match a description in the command, the wrapper is destroyed, and false is returned
from this method.  All other error result in a thrown exception.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Note that commands own the wrappers passed in, and are responsible for managing the
associated memory.

\section{Executing the Sequence}

The mission control sequence is run in a GMAT Sandbox, following a series of steps described in
Section~\ref{section:SandboxMCSExecution}.  In this section, the command specific steps are
described in a bit more detail.
