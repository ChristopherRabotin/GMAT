\chapter{\label{chapter:ConfigurationManager}The Configuration Manager}

User created objects are stored in a vector of object pointers called the configuration. The
Configuration Manager maintains this vector, provides access to the members, and adds new objects
to teh vector as they are created.  This chapter describes how the Configuration Manager performs
these tasks.

\section{Design Principles}

The Configuration Manager Does not initiate communications with any other components of GMAT.  It
responds to requests from the Moderator to store or retrieve components of the GMAT model.

\subsection{Configuration Manager Responsibilities}

The Configuration Manager plays a central role in object storage and retrieval for the model
elements.  It performs the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Maintain the collection of configured objects used in the model.
\item Add new objects to the collection when they are created, ensuring that the new objects have
unique names.
\item Retrieve objects as they are needed.
\item Retrieve the list of stored objects, either by type or generically.
\item Clear the configuration in preparation for a new mission.
\end{enumerate}
