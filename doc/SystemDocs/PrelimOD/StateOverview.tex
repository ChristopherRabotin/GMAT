\section{State Vector Overview}

GMAT requires two distinct types of state information when solving estimation problems.  The
estimators operate on an estimation state vector containing the elements that are estimated or
considered during the estimation process.  That process requires a mechanism that models the
evolution of elements of the estimation state vector -- and, potentially, other model elements --
over time. These elements are assembled into a propagation state vector designed to facilitate fast
numerical evolution from one epoch to another.

State vectors in GMAT

\begin{itemize}
\item Specify the values of the represented parameters at an epoch
\item
\end{itemize}





The following sections describe the classes, derived from GMAT's base state representation, that
are used to model the estimation state vector and the propagation state vector.
