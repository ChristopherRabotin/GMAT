    <title>Installation</title>

    <para>Installers and files for Windows are located on the GMAT SourceForge
    page at <uri>https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmat</uri>. As of this
    writing the latest version is R2012a, released May 23, 2012.</para>

    <para>The GMAT Windows distribution contains an installer that will
    install and configure GMAT for you automatically. By default GMAT will be
    installed into the application data folder in your user profile, and a
    shortcut will be placed in the <guimenu>Start</guimenu> menu.</para>

    <para>GMAT is available as a source code bundle for other platforms. See
    the <link xlink:href="http://gmat.ed-pages.com/wiki/tiki-index.php">GMAT
    Wiki</link> for compiling instructions.</para>

      <title>Starting a GMAT Session</title>

      <para>On Microsoft Windows platforms there are several ways to start a
      GMAT session. If you used the GMAT installer, you can click the
      <guimenuitem>GMAT R2012a</guimenuitem> item in the
      <guimenu>Start</guimenu> menu. If you installed GMAT from a zip file or
      by compiling the system, locate the <filename>bin</filename> directory
      in the GMAT root directory and double-click
      <filename>GMAT.exe</filename>.</para>

      <para>On the Mac, use Finder to open the <filename>bin</filename> folder
      located in the GMAT root directory and open the
      <filename>GMAT</filename> application. Alternatively, open a Terminal
      window, change to your installation directory, then type the command
      <userinput>open GMAT.app</userinput>. Once GMAT is open, you can set it
      to remain in the dock by clicking its dock icon, then
      <guimenu>Options</guimenu>, then <guimenuitem>Keep in
      Dock</guimenuitem>. This allows you to open GMAT in the future simply by
      clicking its dock icon.</para>

      <title>Quitting a GMAT Session</title>

      <para>To end a GMAT session on Windows or Linux, in the menu bar, click
      <guimenu>File</guimenu>, then click <guimenuitem>Exit</guimenuitem>. On
      the Mac, in the menu bar, click <guilabel>GMAT</guilabel>, then click

    <title>Running the GMAT Demos</title>

    <para>The GMAT distribution includes more than 30 sample missions. These
    samples show how to apply GMAT to problems ranging from the Hohmann
    transfer to libration point station-keeping to trajectory optimization. To
    locate and run a sample mission:</para>

    <para>To run optimization missions, you will need MATLAB and the MATLAB
    Optimization Toolbox and/or the VF13ad plugin based on software in the
    Harwell Subroutine Library. These are proprietary libraries and are not
    distributed with GMAT. MATLAB connectivity is not yet fully supported in
    the Mac and Linux GMAT releases, and therefore you cannot run optimization
    missions that use MATLAB’s <function>fmincon</function> optimizer on those
    platforms.</para>

  <section xml:id="UserInterfacesOverview">
    <title>User Interfaces Overview</title>

    <para>GMAT offers multiple ways to design and execute your mission. The
    two primary interfaces are the graphical user interface (GUI) and the
    script interface. These interfaces are interchangeable and each supports
    most of the functionality available in GMAT. When you work in the script
    interface, you are working in GMAT’s custom script language. To avoid
    issues such as circular dependencies, there are some basic rules you must
    follow. Below, we discuss these interfaces and then discuss the basic
    rules and best practices for working in each interface.</para>

    <section>
      <title>GUI Overview</title>

      <para>When you start a session, the GMAT desktop is displayed with a
      default mission already loaded. The GMAT desktop has a native look and
      feel on each platform and most desktop components are supported on all
      platforms.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Windows GUI</title>

        <para>When you open GMAT on Windows and click <guiicon>Run</guiicon>
        in the Toolbar, GMAT executes the default mission as shown in the
        figure below. The tools listed below the figure are available in the
        GMAT desktop.</para>

              <para>On Windows, the <guilabel>File</guilabel> menu contains

              functionality as well as <guilabel>Open Recent</guilabel> and
              <guilabel>New Mission</guilabel>. The <guilabel>Edit</guilabel>
              menu contains functionality for script editing when the script
              editor is active. The <guilabel>Window</guilabel> menu contains
              tools for organizing graphics windows and the script editor
              within the GMAT desktop. Examples include the ability to

              <para>On the Mac, menus are nearly the same, with a few

              <guilabel>Quit GMAT</guilabel> menu option is on the GMAT menu,
              as discussed before; tiling and cascading windows are not
              supported, so those options do not appear under the
              <guilabel>Window</guilabel> menu; currently, email is not
              supported, so <guilabel>Provide Feedback</guilabel> is

              mission execution, and controls for graphics animation. On
              Windows and Linux, the toolbar is located at the top of the GMAT
              window; on the Mac, it is located on the left of the GMAT frame.
              Because the toolbar is vertical on the Mac, some toolbar options
              are abbreviated.</para>

              <para>GMAT allows you to simultaneously edit the raw script file
              representation of your mission and the GUI representation of
              your mission. It is possible to make inconsistent changes in
              these mission representations. The <guilabel>GUI/Script Sync
              Status</guilabel> indicator located in the toolbar shows you the
              state of the two mission representations. See the <xref

      <title>GUI/Script Interface Interactions and Rules</title>

      <para>The GMAT desktop supports both a script interface and a GUI
      interface and these interfaces are designed to be consistent with each
      other. You can think of the script and GUI as different "views" of the
      same data: the resources and the mission command sequence. GMAT allows
      you to switch between views (script and GUI) and have the same view open
      in an editable state simultaneously. Below we describe the behavior,
      interactions, and rules of the script and GUI interfaces so you can
      avoid confusion and potential loss of data.</para>

      <section xml:id="GuiScriptInteractionsAndSynchronization">
        <title>GUI/Script Interactions and Synchronization</title>

        <para>GMAT allows you to simultaneously edit both the script file
        representation and the GUI representation of your mission. It is
        possible to make inconsistent changes in these representations. The
        <guilabel>GUI/Script Sync Status</guilabel> window located in the
        toolbar indicates the state of the two representations. On the Mac,
        the status is indicated in abbreviated form in the left-hand toolbar.
        <guilabel>Synchronized</guilabel> (green) indicates that the script
        and GUI contain the same information. <guilabel>GUI
        Modified</guilabel> (yellow) indicates that there are changes in the
        GUI that have not been saved to the script. <guilabel>Script

        <title>How the GUI Maps to a Script</title>

        <para>Clicking the <guilabel>Save</guilabel> button in the toolbar
        saves the GUI representation to the script file; this is the same file
        you edit when working in the script editor. GUI items that appear in
        the <guilabel>Resources</guilabel> tree appear before the
        <function>BeginMissionSequence</function> command in a script file and
        are written in a predefined order. GUI items that appear in the
        Mission Tree appear after the
        <function>BeginMissionSequence</function> command in a script file in
        the same order as they appear in the GUI.</para>

        <caution>
          <para>If you have a script file that has custom formatting such as
          spacing and data organization, you should work exclusively in the
          script. If you load your script into the GUI, then click
          <guilabel>Save</guilabel> in the toolbar, you will lose the
          formatting of your script. (You will not, however, lose the
          data.)</para>

        <title>How the Script Maps to the GUI</title>

        <para>Clicking the <guilabel>Save,Sync</guilabel> button on the script
        editor saves the script representation and loads it into the GUI. When
        you work in a GMAT script, you work in the raw file that GMAT reads
        and writes. Each script file must contain a command called
        <function>BeginMissionSequence</function>. Script lines that appear
        before the <function>BeginMissionSequence</function> command create
        and configure models and this data will appear in the
        <guilabel>Resources</guilabel> tree in the GUI. Script lines that
        appear after the <function>BeginMissionSequence</function> command
        define your mission sequence and appear in the
        <guilabel>Mission</guilabel> tree in the GUI. Here is a brief script
        example to illustrate:</para>

        <programlisting>Create Spacecraft Sat
Sat.X = 3000
BeginMissionSequence
Sat.X = 1000</programlisting>

        <para>The line <code>Sat.X = 3000</code> sets the x-component of the
        Cartesian state to 3000; this value will appear on the
        <guilabel>Orbit</guilabel> tab of the <guilabel>Spacecraft</guilabel>
        dialog box. However, because the line <code>Sat.X = 1000</code>
        appears after the <function>BeginMissionSequence</function> command,
        the line <code>Sat.X = 1000</code> will appear as an assignment
        command in the <guilabel>Mission</guilabel> tree in the GUI.</para>

    <title>Data and Configuration</title>

    <para>Below we discuss the files and data that are distributed with GMAT
    and are required for GMAT execution. GMAT uses many types of data files,
    including planetary ephemeris files, Earth orientation data, leap second
    files, and gravity coefficient files. This section describes how these
    files are organized and the controls provided to customize them.</para>

    <section>
      <title>File Structure</title>

      <para>The default directory structure for GMAT is broken into eight main
      subdirectories, as shown in <xref
      linkend="GmatRootDirectoryStructure"/>. These directories organize the
      files and data used to run GMAT, including binary libraries, data files,
      texture maps, and 3D models. The only two files in the GMAT root
      directory are <filename>license.txt</filename>, which contains the text
      of the NASA Open Source Agreement, and <filename>README.txt</filename>,
      which contains user information for the current GMAT release. A summary
      of the contents of each subdirectory is provided in the sections
      below.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Configuring GMAT Data Files</title>

      <para>You can configure the data files GMAT loads at run time by editing
      the <filename>gmat_startup_file.txt</filename> file located in the
      <filename>bin</filename> directory. The startup file contains path
      information for data files such as ephemeris, Earth orientation
      parameters and graphics files. By editing the startup file, you can
      customize which files are loaded and used during a GMAT session. Below
      we describe the customization features available in the startup file.
      The order of lines in the startup file does not matter.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Leap Second and EOP files</title>

        <para>GMAT reads several files that are used for high fidelity
        modelling of time and coordinate systems: the leap second files and
        the Earth orientation parameters (EOP) provided by the IERS. The EOP
        file is updated daily by the IERS. To update your local file with the
        latest data, simply replace the file
        <filename>eopc04_08.62-now</filename> in the
        <filename>data/planetary_coeff</filename> directory. Updated versions
        of this file are available from the <link
        xlink:href="http://data.iers.org/products/213/14444/orig/eopc04_08.62-now">IERS</link>.</para>

        <para>There are two leap second files provided with GMAT in the
        <filename>data/time</filename> directory. The
        <filename>naif0010.tls</filename> file is used by the JPL SPICE
        libraries when computing ephemerides. When a new leap second is added,
        you can replace this file with the new file from <link
        xlink:href="ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/lsk/">NAIF</link>.
        GMAT reads the<filename> tai-utc.dat</filename> file for all time
        computations requiring leap seconds that are not performed by the
        SPICE utilities. When a new leap second is added, you can replace this
        file with the new file from the <link
        xlink:href="ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat">US Naval
        Observatory</link>. In addtion, you can modify the file if a new leap
        second is added by simply duplicating the last row and updating it
        with the correct information for the new leap second. For example, if
        a new leapsecond were added on 01 Jul 2013, you would add the
        following line to the bottom of
        <filename>tai-utc.dat</filename>:</para>

        <programlisting>2013 JUL 1 =JD 2456474.5 TAI-UTC= 35.0 S + (MJD - 41317.) X 0.0</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Loading Custom Plugins</title>

        <para>Custom plugins are loaded by adding a line to the startup file
        (<filename>bin/gmat_startup_file.txt</filename>) specifying the name
        and location of the plugin file. In order for a plugin to work with
        GMAT, the plugin library must be placed in the folder referenced in
        the startup file. You specify the path to a plugin file using the
        "PLUGIN" keyword and specify the file by providing its name without
        the file extension (.dll on Windows). For example, to load a Windows
        plugin named <filename>libVF13Optimizer.dll</filename> located in the
        <filename>plugins/proprietary</filename> directory, you would add this
        line to your startup file:</para>

        <programlisting>PLUGIN = ../plugins/proprietary/libVF13Optimizer</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>User-defined Function Paths</title>

        <para>If you create custom GMAT or MATLAB functions, you can provide
        the path to those files and GMAT will locate them at run time. The
        default startup file is configured so you can place GMAT function
        files (with a <filename>.gmf</filename> extension) in the
        <filename>userfunctions/gmat</filename> directory and place MATLAB
        functions (with a <filename>.m</filename> extension) in the
        <filename>userfunctions/matlab</filename> directory. GMAT
        automatically searches those locations at run time. You can change the
        location of the search path to your GMAT or MATLAB functions by
        changing these lines in your startup file to reflect the location of
        your files with respect to the GMAT <filename>bin</filename>
        folder:</para>

        <programlisting>GMAT_FUNCTION_PATH = ../userfunctions/gmat
MATLAB_FUNCTION_PATH = ../userfunctions/matlab</programlisting>

        <para>If you wish to organize your custom functions in multiple
        folders, you can add multiple search paths to the startup file. For
        example,</para>

        <programlisting>GMAT_FUNCTION_PATH = ../MyFunctions/utils
GMAT_FUNCTION_PATH = ../MyFunctions/StateConversion 
GMAT_FUNCTION_PATH = ../MyFunctions/TimeConversion</programlisting>

        <para>GMAT will search the paths in the order specified in the startup
        file and will use the first function with a matching name.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Configuring the MATLAB Interface</title>

      <para>GMAT features a MATLAB interface that allows you to run MATLAB
      functions from within GMAT.</para>

      <para>This interface is packaged as an optional GMAT plugin. To use it,
      make sure the following line is present in your
      <filename>gmat_startup_file.txt</filename> and has no comment symbol
      (<code>#</code>) in front of it.</para>

      <programlisting>PLUGIN = ../plugins/libMatlabInterface</programlisting>

      <para>The MATLAB interface must be able to find your MATLAB
      installation. The procedure for setting this information varies by
      platform.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Windows</title>

        <para>On Windows, MATLAB must be properly configured in two places:
        the system <envar>Path</envar> variable and the Windows registry. Both
        locations must be configured for the same MATLAB version.</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The following directories must exist in your system’s
            <envar>Path</envar> variable, where
            <filename><replaceable>&lt;MATLAB&gt;</replaceable></filename> is
            the path to the MATLAB root directory:</para>

            <programlisting><replaceable>&lt;MATLAB&gt;</replaceable>/bin/win32
<replaceable>&lt;MATLAB&gt;</replaceable>/bin</programlisting>

            <para>If you have multiple versions of MATLAB installed, GMAT will
            use the one that appears first in the system path.</para>

            <caution>
              <para>For some versions of MATLAB (e.g. R2010a), MATLAB and
              Windows are distributed with libraries that have the same name,
              resulting in a conflict. As a workaround, you may need to place
              the folders above at the beginning of your system path.</para>

        <title>Mac OS X</title>

        <para>On Mac OS X, to use MATLAB with GMAT, you must set the
        <envar>MATLABFORGMAT</envar> environment variable in your
        <filename>environment.plist</filename> file, located in the
        <filename>.MacOSX</filename> directory in your home folder. This
        environment variable should point to the location of your MATLAB
        installation (application bundle). GMAT will not interface with MATLAB
        unless this environment variable is set.</para>

        <para>The current Mac application includes the ability to make calls
        to MATLAB functions from within GMAT, but does not support calls
        MATLAB to GMAT (including the <function>fmincon</function>
        optimizer).</para>

        <para>Note that when GMAT opens MATLAB, it will open X11 first (as is
        required for MATLAB execution). GMAT currently does not automatically
        close X11 after quitting MATLAB, so you will need to quit X11
        manually.</para>

        <para>To add the environment variable:</para>

        <procedure>
          <step>
            <para>If the <filename>environment.plist</filename> file already
            exists in your <filename>.MacOSX</filename> directory, edit the
            file using the Property List Editor to add the
            <filename>MATLABFORGMAT</filename> variable and set it to point to
            the location of your MATLAB application (e.g.
            <filename>/Applications/MATLAB_R2010a/MATLAB_R2010a.app</filename>).</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>If you do not have an <filename>environment.plist</filename>
            file in your <filename>.MacOSX</filename> directory, open a
            Terminal window and follow these steps:</para>

            <procedure>
              <step>
                <para>Create the <filename>.MacOSX</filename> directory as a
                directory in your home folder (if it does not exist).</para>
              </step>

              <step>
                <para>Open the Property List Editor and create the
                <envar>MATLABFORGMAT</envar> variable as described
                above.</para>
              </step>

              <step>
                <para>Save the property list as
                <filename>environment.plist</filename> in the
                <filename>.MacOSX</filename> directory.</para>
              </step>
            </procedure>
          </step>
        </procedure>

        <para>You must logout and log back in for this to take effect.</para>
