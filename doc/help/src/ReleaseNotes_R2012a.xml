      <title>Ground Track Plot</title>

      <para>GMAT can now show the ground track of a spacecraft using the new
      <guilabel>GroundTrackPlot</guilabel> resource. This view shows the
      orbital path of one or more spacecraft projected onto a two-dimensional
      map of a celestial body, and can use any celestial body that you have
      configured. Here's an example of the plot created as part of the default
      mission:</para>

    <section>
      <title>Orbit Designer</title>

      <para>Sometimes you need to create a spacecraft in a particular orbit
      but don't exactly know the proper orbital element values. Before, you
      had to make a rough estimate, or go back to the math to figure it out.
      Now, GMAT R2012a comes with a new <guilabel>Orbit Designer</guilabel>
      that does this math for you.</para>

      <para>The <guilabel>Orbit Designer</guilabel> helps you create one of
      six different Earth-centered orbit types, each with a flexible array of
      input options:</para>

      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para>sun-synchronous</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>repeat sun-synchronous</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>repeat ground track</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>

          <para>frozen</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Once you've created your desired orbit, it is automatically
      imported into the Spacecraft resource for later use. Here's an example
      of a sun-synchronous orbit using the Designer. To open the
      <guilabel>Orbit Designer</guilabel>, click the button on the
      <guilabel>Spacecraft</guilabel> properties window.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Eclipse Locator [alpha]</title>

      <para>We've done significant work toward having a robust eclipse
      location tool in GMAT, but this work is not complete. This release comes
      with an alpha-stage plugin (disabled by default) called
      <filename>libEventLocator</filename>. When enabled, this plugin adds a
      new <guilabel>EclipseLocator</guilabel> resource that can be configured
      to calculate eclipse entry and exit times and durations with respect to
      any configured Spacecraft and celestial bodies. The eclipse data can be
      reported to a text file or plotted graphically. Some known limitations
      include an assumption of spherical celestial bodies and a lack of
      light-time correction. This feature has not been rigorously tested, and
      may be brittle. We've included it here as a preview of what's coming in
      future releases.</para>

    <section>
      <title>C Interface [alpha]</title>

      <para>Likewise, we've included an experimental library and plugin that
      exposes a plain-C interface to GMAT's internal dynamics model
      functionality. This interface is intended to fill a very specific need:
      to expose force model derivates from GMAT to external software,
      especially MATLAB, for use with an external integrator (though GMAT can
      do the propagation also, if desired). The interface is documented by an
      <link
      xlink:href="http://gmat.sourceforge.net/docs/R2012a/capi/index.html">API
      reference</link> for now.</para>

    <title>Improvements</title>

    <section>
      <title>Dynamics Models</title>

      <para>We've made lots of improvements to GMAT's already capable force
      model suite. Here's some highlights:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>GMAT now models Earth ocean and pole tides. This is a
          script-only option that can be turned on alongside an Earth harmonic
          gravity model; turn it on with a line like this:</para>

          <programlisting><replaceable>ForceModel</replaceable>.GravityField.Earth.EarthTideModel = 'SolidAndPole'</programlisting>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You can now apply relativistic corrections using the checkbox
          on the properties for <guilabel>Propagator</guilabel>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Solar System</title>

      <para>GMAT can now use the DE421 and DE424 ephemerides for the solar
      system. These files are included in the installer, but are not activated
      by default. To use either of these ephemerides, double-click the
      <guilabel>SolarSystem</guilabel> folder and select it from the
      <guilabel>Ephemeris Source</guilabel> list. Or include the following
      script line:</para>

      <programlisting>SolarSystem.EphemerisSource = 'DE421'</programlisting>

      <para>There's also a new <guilabel>SolarSystem</guilabel> resource
      called <guilabel>SolarSystemBarycenter</guilabel> that represents the
      barycenter as given by the chosen ephemeris source (DE405, DE421, SPICE,
      etc.). This resource can be used directly in reports or as the origin of
      a user-defined coordinate system.</para>

    <section>
      <title>TDB Input</title>

      <para>You can now input the epoch of a <guilabel>Spacecraft</guilabel>
      orbit in the TDB time system (in both Modified Julian and Gregorian
      formats).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Mission Tree</title>

      <para>We've made significant improvements to the mission tree to make it
      more user-friendly to heavy users. The biggest improvement is that you
      can now filter the mission sequence in different ways to make complex
      missions easier to understand, for example by hiding non-physical events
      or collapsing the tree to only its top-level elements.</para>

      <para><screenshot>
          <info>
            <title/>
          </info>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="files/images/relnotes/r2012a/mtfilters.png"
                         scale="75"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot></para>

      <para>GMAT also now lets you name your mission sequence commands. Thus,
      instead of a sequence made up of commands like "Optimize1" and
      "Propagate3", you can label them "Optimize LOI" and "Prop to Periapsis".
      This example shows the <filename>Ex_HohmannTransfer.script</filename>
      sample with labeled commands.</para>

      <para><screenshot>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot></para>

      <para>Finally, we added the ability to undock the mission tree so you
      can place it and the resources tree side by side and see both at the
      same time. To undock the tree, right-click the
      <guilabel>Mission</guilabel> tab and drag it from its docked position.
      To dock it again, just close the new <guilabel>Mission</guilabel>
      window.</para>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot></para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Mission Summary</title>

      <para>You can now change the coordinate system shown in the
      <guilabel>Mission Summary</guilabel> on the fly: just change the
      <guilabel>Coordinate System</guilabel> list at the top of the window and
      the numbers will update. This feature can use any coordinate system
      currently defined in GMAT, including user-defined ones.</para>

      <para>There's also a new <guilabel>Mission Summary - Physics-Based
      Commands</guilabel> that shows only physical events
      (<guilabel>Propagate</guilabel> commands, burns, etc.), and further data
      was added to both <guilabel>Mission Summary</guilabel> types.</para>

      <para><screenshot>
          <info>
            <title/>
          </info>

          <mediaobject>

              <imagedata contentdepth="100%"
                         fileref="files/images/relnotes/r2012a/missionsummary.png"
                         scalefit="1" width="100%"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot></para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Window Persistency</title>

      <para>The locations of output windows are now saved with the mission in
      the script file. This means that when running a mission, all the output
      windows that were open when the mission was last saved will reappear in
      their old positions.</para>

      <para>In addition, the locations of certain GMAT windows, like the
      mission tree, the script editor, and the application window itself are
      saved to the user preferences file
      (<filename>MyGMAT.ini</filename>).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Switch to Visual Studio on Windows</title>

      <para>With this release, the official GMAT binaries for Windows are now
      compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 instead of GCC. The biggest
      benefit of this is in performance; we've seen up to a 50% performance
      improvement in certain cases in unofficial testing. It also leads to
      more a industry-standard development process on Windows, as the MinGW
      suite is no longer needed.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>New Icons</title>

      <para>The last release saw a major overhaul of GMAT's GUI icons. This
      time we've revised some and added more, especially in the mission
      tree.</para>

        </inlinemediaobject></para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Training Manual</title>

      <para>The non-reference material in the GMAT User Guide has been
      overhauled, partially rewritten, and reformatted to form a new GMAT
      Training Manual. This includes the "Getting Started" material, some
      short how-to articles, and some longer tutorials. All of this
      information is included in the GMAT User Guide as well, in addition to
      reference material that is undergoing a similar rewrite later this
      year.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Infrastructure</title>

      <para>The GMAT project has implemented several infrastructure
      improvements in the last year. The biggest of these was switching from
      our old Bugzilla system to <link
      xlink:href="http://li64-187.members.linode.com:8080">JIRA</link> for
      issue tracking.</para>

      <para>This year also saw the creation of the <link
      xlink:href="http://gmat.sourceforge.net/blog/">GMAT Blog</link> and the
      <link xlink:href="http://gmatplugins.sourceforge.net/blog/">GMAT Plugins
      and Extensions Blog</link> with a fair number of posts each, plus
      reorganizations for the <link
      xlink:href="http://gmat.ed-pages.com/wiki/tiki-index.php">wiki</link>
      and the <link
      xlink:href="http://gmat.ed-pages.com/forum/">forums</link>. We
      reactivated our two mailing lists, <link
      xlink:href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/gmat-developers">gmat-developers</link>
      and <link
      xlink:href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/gmat-users">gmat-users</link>,
      but haven't seen much usage of each yet. And finally, we created a new
      mailing list, <link
      xlink:href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/gmat-buildtest">gmat-buildtest</link>,
      for automated daily build and test updates.</para>
