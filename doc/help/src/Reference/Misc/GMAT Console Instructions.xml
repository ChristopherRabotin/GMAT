<title>GMAT Console Instructions</title>
<para>Thanks to DJC for the instructions.</para>
<para>This page needs to be changed to match the style guide.</para>
<para>If you just run gmatConsole from a terminal window, it will prompt you for a script file name.  Entering the name runs the script, and returns you to a prompt to either quit or run another script.</para>
<para>The console application can also be run in "batch" mode.  To do that, create a file listing the scripts you want to run (including path information if the scripts are not in the bin directory), one per line, and save that file where you can find it.  Then run the batch file by typing "gmatConsole --batch" to run all of the scripts listed in the batch file.</para>
