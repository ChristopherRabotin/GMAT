  <title xml:id="IntroductionToGMAT">Introduction to GMAT</title>

  <para>GMAT is an open source trajectory design and optimization system
  developed by NASA and private industry. It is developed in an open source
  process to maximize technology transfer, to permit anyone to develop and
  validate new algorithms, and to enable those new algorithms to quickly
  transition into the high fidelity core.</para>

  <para>GMAT is designed to model and optimize spacecraft trajectories in
  flight regimes ranging from low Earth orbit to lunar, interplanetary, and
  other deep space missions. The system supports constrained and unconstrained
  trajectory optimization and built-in features make defining cost and
  constraint functions trivial. GMAT also contains initial value solvers
  (propagators) and boundary value solvers and efficiently propagates
  spacecraft either singly or as coupled sets. GMAT’s propagators naturally
  synchronize the epochs of multiple vehicles and avoid fixed step integration
  and interpolation when doing so.</para>

  <para>Users can interact with GMAT using either a graphical user interface
  (GUI) or a custom scripting language modeled after the syntax used in The
  MathWorks’ MATLAB® system. All of the system elements can be expressed
  through either interface, and users can convert between the two in either
  direction.</para>

  <para>Analysts model space missions in GMAT by first creating and
  configuring resources such as spacecraft, propagators, optimizers, and data
  files. These resources are then used in a mission sequence to model the
  trajectory of the spacecraft and simulate mission events. The mission
  sequence supports commands such as nonlinear constraints, minimization,
  propagatation, GMAT and MATLAB functions, inline equations, and script
  events.</para>

  <para>GMAT can display trajectories in a realistic three-dimensional view,
  plot parameters against one another, and save parameters to files for later
  processing. The graphics capabilities are fully interactive, plotting data
  as a mission is run and allowing users to zoom into regions of interest.
  Trajectories and data can be viewed in any coordinate system defined in
  GMAT, and GMAT allows users to rotate the view and set the focus to any
  object in the display. The trajectory view can be animated so users can
  watch the evolution of the trajectory over time.</para>

    <title>Licensing</title>

    <para>GMAT is licensed under the NASA Open Source Agreement v1.3. The
    license text is contained in the file <filename>License.txt</filename> in
    root directory of the GMAT distribution.</para>

    <title>Platform Support</title>

    <para>GMAT is cross-platform software and runs on Windows, Linux, and
    Macintosh platforms, on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. It uses the
    wxWidgets cross-platform user interface toolkit and can be built using
    either Microsoft Visual Studio or the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). GMAT
    is written in ANSI standard C++ (approximately 380,000 non-comment source
    lines of code) using an object-oriented methodology, with a rich class
    structure designed to make new features simple to incorporate.</para>

  <section>
    <title>User Interfaces</title>

    <para>GMAT has several user interfaces. The interactive graphical user
    interface is introduced in more detail in later sections. The script
    interface is textual and also allows the user to configure and execute all
    aspects of GMAT. There is a secondary MATLAB interface that allows for
    running the system via calls from MATLAB to GMAT and allows GMAT to call
    MATLAB functions from within the GMAT command sequence. A low-level C API
    is also currently under development.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Development Status</title>

    <para>While GMAT has undergone extensive testing and is mature software,
    at the present time we consider the software to be in beta form on Windows
    and alpha on Linux and Mac. GMAT is not yet sufficiently verified to be
    used as a primary operational analysis system. It has been used to
    optimize maneuvers for flight projects such as NASA’s LCROSS and ARTEMIS
    missions, and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and for optimization and
    analysis for the OSIRIS-REx and MMS missions. However, for flight
    planning, we independently verify solutions generated in GMAT in the
    primary operational system.</para>

    <para>The GMAT team is currently working on several activities including
    maintenance, bug fixes, and testing, along with selected new
    functionality.</para>

    <title>Contributors</title>

    <para>The Navigation and Mission Design Branch at NASA’s Goddard Space
    Flight Center performs project management activities and is involved in
    most phases of the development process including requirements, algorithms,
    design, and testing. The Ground Software Systems Branch performs design,
    implementation, and integration testing. The Flight Software Branch
    contributes to design and implementation. GMAT contributors include
    volunteers and those paid for services they provide. We welcome new
    contributors to the project, either as users providing feedback about the
    features of the system, or as developers interested in contributing to the
    implementation of the system. Current and past contributors
    include:</para>
