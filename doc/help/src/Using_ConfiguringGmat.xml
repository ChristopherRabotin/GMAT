  <title>Configuring GMAT</title>

  <para>Below we discuss the files and data that are distributed with GMAT and
  are required for GMAT execution. GMAT uses many types of data files,
  including planetary ephemeris files, Earth orientation data, leap second
  files, and gravity coefficient files. This section describes how these files
  are organized and the controls provided to customize them.</para>

  <section>
    <title>File Structure</title>

    <para>The default directory structure for GMAT is broken into eight main
    subdirectories, as shown in <xref linkend="GmatRootDirectoryStructure"/>.
    These directories organize the files and data used to run GMAT, including
    binary libraries, data files, texture maps, and 3D models. The only two
    files in the GMAT root directory are <filename>license.txt</filename>,
    which contains the text of the NASA Open Source Agreement, and
    <filename>README.txt</filename>, which contains user information for the
    current GMAT release. A summary of the contents of each subdirectory is
    provided in the sections below.</para>

    <section>
      <title><filename>bin</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>bin</filename> directory contains all binary files
      required for the core functionality of GMAT. These libraries include the
      executable file (<filename>GMAT.exe</filename> on Windows,
      <filename>GMAT.app</filename> on the Mac, and <filename>GMAT</filename>
      on Linux) and platform-specific support libraries. The
      <filename>bin</filename> directory also contains two text files:
      <filename>gmat_startup_file.txt</filename> and
      <filename>gmat.ini</filename>. The startup file is discussed in detail
      in a separate section below. The <filename>gmat.ini</filename> file is
      used to configure some GUI panels, set paths to external web links, and
      define GUI tooltip messages.</para>

      User’s Guide is available in the <filename>help</filename> directory in
      PDF and HTML formats, and as a Windows HTML Help file.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>extras</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>extras</filename> directory contains various extra
      convenience files that are helpful for working with GMAT but aren't part
      of the core codebase. The only file here so far is a syntax coloring
      file for the GMAT scripting language in the Notepad++ text
      editor.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>matlab</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>matlab</filename> directory contains M-files
      required for GMAT’s MATLAB interfaces, including the interface to the
      fmincon optimizer and interfaces for driving GMAT from MATLAB. All files
      in the <filename>matlab</filename> directory and its subdirectories must
      be included in your MATLAB path for the MATLAB interfaces to function
      properly.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>output</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>output</filename> directory is the default location
      for file output such as ephemeris files and report files. If no path
      information is provided for reports or ephemeris files created during a
      GMAT session, then those files will be written to the output
      folder.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>plugins</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>plugins</filename> directory contains optional
      plugins that are not required for use of GMAT. The
      <filename>proprietary</filename> directory is used for for third-party
      libraries that cannot be distributed freely and is an empty folder in
      the open source distribution.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>samples</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>samples</filename> directory contains over 30 sample
      missions, ranging from a Hohmann transfer to libration point
      station-keeping to Mars B-plane targeting. These files are intended to
      demonstrate GMAT’s capabilities and to provide you with a potential
      starting point for building common mission types for your application
      and flight regime. Samples with specific requirements are located in
      subdirectories such as <filename>NeedMatlab</filename> and
      <filename>NeedVF13ad</filename>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>userfunctions</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>userfunctions</filename> directory contains GMAT and
      MATLAB functions that are included in the GMAT distribution. You can
      also store your own custom GMAT and MATLAB functions in these
      folders.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Configuring Data Files</title>

    <para>You can configure the data files GMAT loads at run time by editing
    the <filename>gmat_startup_file.txt</filename> file located in the
    <filename>bin</filename> directory. The startup file contains path
    information for data files such as ephemeris, Earth orientation parameters
    and graphics files. By editing the startup file, you can customize which
    files are loaded and used during a GMAT session. Below we describe the
    customization features available in the startup file. The order of lines
    in the startup file does not matter.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Leap Second and EOP files</title>

      <para>GMAT reads several files that are used for high fidelity modelling
      of time and coordinate systems: the leap second files and the Earth
      orientation parameters (EOP) provided by the IERS. The EOP file is
      updated daily by the IERS. To update your local file with the latest
      data, simply replace the file <filename>eopc04_08.62-now</filename> in
      the <filename>data/planetary_coeff</filename> directory. Updated
      versions of this file are available from the <link
      xlink:href="http://data.iers.org/products/213/14444/orig/eopc04_08.62-now">IERS</link>.</para>

      <para>There are two leap second files provided with GMAT in the
      <filename>data/time</filename> directory. The
      <filename>naif0010.tls</filename> file is used by the JPL SPICE
      libraries when computing ephemerides. When a new leap second is added,
      you can replace this file with the new file from <link
      xlink:href="ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/lsk/">NAIF</link>.
      GMAT reads the<filename> tai-utc.dat</filename> file for all time
      computations requiring leap seconds that are not performed by the SPICE
      utilities. When a new leap second is added, you can replace this file
      with the new file from the <link
      xlink:href="ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat">US Naval
      Observatory</link>. In addtion, you can modify the file if a new leap
      second is added by simply duplicating the last row and updating it with
      the correct information for the new leap second. For example, if a new
      leapsecond were added on 01 Jul 2013, you would add the following line
      to the bottom of <filename>tai-utc.dat</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>2013 JUL 1 =JD 2456474.5 TAI-UTC= 35.0 S + (MJD - 41317.) X 0.0</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Loading Custom Plugins</title>

      <para>Custom plugins are loaded by adding a line to the startup file
      (<filename>bin/gmat_startup_file.txt</filename>) specifying the name and
      location of the plugin file. In order for a plugin to work with GMAT,
      the plugin library must be placed in the folder referenced in the
      startup file. You specify the path to a plugin file using the "PLUGIN"
      keyword and specify the file by providing its name without the file
      extension (.dll on Windows). For example, to load a Windows plugin named
      <filename>libVF13Optimizer.dll</filename> located in the
      <filename>plugins/proprietary</filename> directory, you would add this
      line to your startup file:</para>

      <programlisting>PLUGIN = ../plugins/proprietary/libVF13Optimizer</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>User-defined Function Paths</title>

      <para>If you create custom GMAT or MATLAB functions, you can provide the
      path to those files and GMAT will locate them at run time. The default
      startup file is configured so you can place GMAT function files (with a
      <filename>.gmf</filename> extension) in the
      <filename>userfunctions/gmat</filename> directory and place MATLAB
      functions (with a <filename>.m</filename> extension) in the
      <filename>userfunctions/matlab</filename> directory. GMAT automatically
      searches those locations at run time. You can change the location of the
      search path to your GMAT or MATLAB functions by changing these lines in
      your startup file to reflect the location of your files with respect to
      the GMAT <filename>bin</filename> folder:</para>

      <programlisting>GMAT_FUNCTION_PATH = ../userfunctions/gmat
MATLAB_FUNCTION_PATH = ../userfunctions/matlab</programlisting>

      <para>If you wish to organize your custom functions in multiple folders,
      you can add multiple search paths to the startup file. For
      example,</para>

      <programlisting>GMAT_FUNCTION_PATH = ../MyFunctions/utils
GMAT_FUNCTION_PATH = ../MyFunctions/StateConversion 
GMAT_FUNCTION_PATH = ../MyFunctions/TimeConversion</programlisting>

      <para>GMAT will search the paths in the order specified in the startup
      file and will use the first function with a matching name.</para>
