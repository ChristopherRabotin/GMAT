  <para>The <guilabel>Command Summary</guilabel> is a summary of orbit and
  spacecraft state information after execution of a command. For example, if
  the command is a <guilabel>Propagate</guilabel> command, the
  <guilabel>Command Summary</guilabel> contains state data after propagation
  is performed.</para>

  <para>To view the <guilabel>Command Summary</guilabel>, right-click on the
  desired command, and select <guilabel>Command Summary</guilabel>. Or
  alternatively, double-click on the desired command, and click the
  <guilabel>Command Summary</guilabel> icon located near the lower left corner
  of the panel. You must run the mission before viewing <guilabel>Command
  Summary</guilabel> data.</para>

    <title>Data Availability</title>

    <para>To view a <guilabel>Command Summary</guilabel>, you must first run
    the mission. If the mission has not been run during the current session,
    the <guilabel>Command Summary</guilabel> will be empty. If changes are
    made to your configuration, you must rerun the mission for those changes
    to take effect in the <guilabel>Command Summary</guilabel>.</para>

    <title>Data Contents</title>

    <para>The <guilabel>Command Summary</guilabel> contains several types of
    data. Orbit state representations include Cartesian, spherical, and
    Keplerian. For hyperbolic orbits, B-Plane coordinates, DLA and RLA are
    provided. Planetodetic information includes Longitude and Latitude among
    others. For a <guilabel>Maneuver</guilabel> command, the Maneuver
    properties are displayed in the CoordinateSystem specified on the
    <guilabel>ImpulsiveBurn</guilabel> resource.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Supported Commands</title>

    <para>For performance reasons, propagation in step mode does not write out
    a command summary. Additionally, if a command is nested in control logic
    and that command does not execute as a result, no command summary data is
    available.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Coordinate Systems</title>

    <para>The <guilabel>Coordinate System</guilabel> menu at the top of the
    <guilabel>Command Summary</guilabel> dialog allows you to select the
    desired coordinate system for the state data. GMAT currently requires that
    the origin of the coordinate system is a celestial body (this will change
    in a future release) and the <guilabel>CoordinateSystem</guilabel> cannot
    reference another spacecraft.</para>
