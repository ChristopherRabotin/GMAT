  <title>Known issues</title>
  <p>
    This page lists currently known issues in the current release.
  </p>
  <note>
    <p>
      For additional information on known issues in Apache&#8482; FOP, please have a look at the following pages, too:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><link href="../bugs.html">the bug list in Bugzilla</link></li>
      <li><link href="http://wiki.apache.org/xmlgraphics-fop/FOPProjectTasks">the task list in the Wiki</link></li>
    </ul>
  </note>
  <p>
    Apache&#8482; FOP has an extensive automated testing infrastructure. Parts of this infrastructure are several
    sets of test cases. When a test case is listed in disabled-testcases.xml it is disabled in the JUnit 
    tests during the normal build process. This indicates a problem in the current codebase. When a bug is 
    fixed or a missing feature is added the entry for the relevant test case(s) are removed.
  </p>
  <section>
    <title>FO Tree</title>
    <p>
      This section lists disabled test cases in the test suite for the FO tree tests, at the time
      of the release.
    </p>
    <p><strong>demo-test-failure.fo</strong> (demo test failure):<br/><em>TODO: Add missing description in disabled-testcases.xml!</em></p><p/><p><strong>from-table-column_marker.fo</strong> (Markers and core function evaluation):<br/>The code currently evaluates this function according to the column in which the 
    marker appears in the source document, rather than the column it is retrieved in.</p><p/>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Layout Engine</title>
    <p>
      This section lists disabled test cases in the test suite for the layout engine tests, at the
      time of the release.
    </p>
    <p><strong>basic-link_external-destination_2.xml</strong> (External link around an SVG not properly sized):<br/>The bpd trait of the inlineparent area for the basic-link
    is not sized correctly if it wraps an image that is higher than the 
    nominal line.</p><p/><p><strong>block-container_space-before_space-after_3.xml</strong> (Auto-height block-containers produce fences):<br/>Block-containers with no height currently don't
    create a fence for spaces as they should (they behave like a
    normal block).</p><p/><p><strong>block_font-stretch.xml</strong> (font-stretch NYI):<br/>Font-stretch is not implemented, yet.</p><p/><p><strong>block_hyphenation_linefeed_preserve.xml</strong> (Hyphenation with preserved linefeeds):<br/>When hyphenation is enabled and linefeeds are preserved,

    correctly.</p><p/><p><strong>block_white-space-treatment_3.xml</strong> (white-space-treatment):<br/>White space handling incorrectly stops at fo:inline
      boundaries when it comes to formatter generated line breaks.</p><p/><p><strong>block_space-before_space-after_8.xml</strong> (Empty blocks produce fences):<br/>An empty block currently produces a fence for
    stacking constraints which it shouldn't.</p><p/><p><strong>block_white-space_nbsp_2.xml</strong> (block white-space nbsp 2):<br/>The nbsp given as an fo:character is not adjustable and therefore
    the justification does not work in this case.</p><p/><p><strong>block_word-spacing.xml</strong> (block word-spacing):<br/>Word-spacing may not work as expected.</p><p/><p><strong>block_word-spacing_text-align_justify.xml</strong> (block word-spacing text-align justify):<br/>Word-spacing may not work as expected.</p><p/><p><strong>external-graphic_oversized.xml</strong> (external-graphic don't shrink):<br/>Images currently don't shrink so they fit on a page
    when they are too big and shrinking is allowed to
    happen (min/opt/max).</p><p/><p><strong>external-graphic_src_uri.xml</strong> (Test case with HTTP URL):<br/>Doesn't work behind a proxy which requires
    authorization.</p><p/><p><strong>footnote_space-resolution.xml</strong> (Space Resolution in foot note area):<br/>Space resolution does not work between footnote
    regions.</p><p/><p><strong>inline_block_nested_3.xml</strong> (NPE for table inside an inline):<br/>Placing a table as a child of an fo:inline produces a 
    NullPointerException.</p><p/><p><strong>inline-container_block_nested.xml</strong> (inline-container is not implemented, yet.):<br/>inline-container is not implemented, yet. Content of an 
    inline-container will get swallowed. The test case contains no checks.</p><p/><p><strong>inline-container_border_padding.xml</strong> (inline-container is not implemented, yet.):<br/>inline-container is not implemented, yet. Content of an 
    inline-container will get swallowed.</p><p/><p><strong>inline_letter-spacing.xml</strong> (inline letter-spacing):<br/>Letter-spacing may not work as
    expected within fo:inline.</p><p/><p><strong>inline_word-spacing.xml</strong> (inline word-spacing):<br/>Word-spacing may not work as expected within
    fo:inline.</p><p/><p><strong>inline_word-spacing_text-align_justify.xml</strong> (inline word-spacing text-align justify):<br/><em>TODO: Add missing description in disabled-testcases.xml!</em></p><p/><p><strong>leader-alignment.xml</strong> (leader-alignment NYI):<br/>Leader-alignment is not yet
    implemented.</p><p/><p><strong>leader_leader-pattern_use-content_bug.xml</strong> (leader-pattern="use-content": Problem with line height):<br/>Line height is not correctly calculated for
    use-content leaders whose height is larger than the rest of the
    line.<br/>

    between pages of a single page-sequence. Element list generation has to be reset to
    redetermine line breaks in this case.</p><p/><p><strong>page-breaking_6.xml</strong> (Overflow handing is incomplete):<br/>Line breaking is not 100% correct when there's too little space. 
    Overflows are not detected and warned.</p><p/><p><strong>page-height_indefinite_simple.xml</strong> (Indefinite page height handling is imcomplete):<br/>A RuntimeException is thrown for a page of indefinite height. Lots of warnings.</p><p/><p><strong>page-number-citation_background-image.xml</strong> (page-number-citation: Problem with background-image):<br/>Background-images on page-number-citations are not
    placed correctly.</p><p/><p><strong>page-number-citation_complex_1.xml</strong> (IDs are not working on all FO elements):<br/>The "id" attributes are not properly handled for all block-level FO elements.</p><p/><p><strong>page-number-citation_complex_2.xml</strong> (IDs are not working on all FO elements):<br/>The "id" attributes are not properly handled for all inline-level FO elements.</p><p/><p><strong>region-body_column-count_footnote.xml</strong> (Footnotes in multi-column documents):<br/>Footnotes may overlap with text of the region-body in
    multi-column documents.</p><p/><p><strong>region-body_column-count_balance_4col.xml</strong> (Column Balancing problems):<br/>Situation in a 4-column document where the column balancing doesn't work and even causes some
    content to disappear.</p><p/><p><strong>region-body_column-count_bug36356.xml</strong> (Column Balancing problems):<br/>Column balancing doesn't work as expected.</p><p/><p><strong>table-cell_empty_area_with_marker.xml</strong> (table-cell empty area with marker.xml):<br/>A table-cell producing an empty area does currently not add any markers to a page. 
      See TODO entry in AreaAdditionUtil.</p><p/><p><strong>table_border-width_conditionality.xml</strong> (Border conditionality on table):<br/>The code should be ok, but the test case uses shorthands and therefore
    is probably not expressing the indended outcome according to the spec. The test
    case should be revisited.</p><p/><p><strong>block_shy_linebreaking_hyph.xml</strong> (Soft hyphen with normal hyphenation enabled):<br/>A soft hyphen should be a preferred as break compared to a
    normal hyphenation point but is not.</p><p/><p><strong>keep_within-page_multi-column_overflow.xml</strong> (Page-keep not respected in multi-column layout):<br/>The block should cause overflow in the
    last column on the page, rather than be broken.</p><p/>
