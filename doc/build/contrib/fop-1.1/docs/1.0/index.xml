      <p>
        The Apache&#8482; FOP team is proud to present to you this production
        quality codebase. FOP 1.0 provides a good subset of the W3C
        XSL-FO 1.0 and 1.1 Standards. Its stable, 1.0 designation
        provides added recognition as the productive tool it has been
        for years.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		We remain committed to improving the tool, and we continue to
		add new features. We welcome any feedback you might have and
		even more, any other form of help to get the project forward.
