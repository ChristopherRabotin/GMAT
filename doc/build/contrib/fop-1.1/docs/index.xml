      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Apache&#8482; FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) is a print formatter driven by XSL
        formatting objects (XSL-FO) and an output independent formatter. It is a Java
        application that reads a formatting object (FO) tree and renders the resulting
        pages to a specified output. <link href="1.1/output.html">Output formats</link>
        currently supported include PDF, PS, PCL, AFP, XML (area tree representation),
        Print, AWT and PNG, and to a lesser extent, RTF and TXT. The primary output target is PDF.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apache&#8482; FOP project is part of the <link href="http://www.apache.org">Apache&#8482;</link>
        Software Foundation, which is a wider community of users and developers of open source projects.

    <title>Demonstration</title>

<p>
This image is a demonstration of a real two page document. The XML data on the left
is formatted into the two pages on the right. The document contains static areas that appear on every page, an external graphic, a footnote on the first page, and a table that goes across both pages.
</p>
<p>
FOP uses the standard XSL-FO file format as input, lays the content out into pages, then renders it to the requested output.
One great advantage of using XSL-FO as input is that XSL-FO is itself an XML file, which means that it can be conveniently created from a variety of sources.
The most common method is to convert semantic XML to XSL-FO, using an XSLT transformation.</p>

    <title>FOP Objectives</title>
    <p>The goals of the Apache FOP project are to deliver an XSL-FO to PDF formatter that
      is compliant to at least the Basic conformance level described in the W3C
      Recommendation from 05 December 2006, and that complies with the November 2001
      Portable Document Format Specification (Version 1.4) from Adobe Systems.
    </p>

    <p>Conformance to the XML 1.0 and 1.1 Recommendations, XSLT 1.0 and 2.0 Recommendations and the XML Namespaces Recommendation is
       understood. Other relevant documents, such as the XPath and XLink Working Drafts, are referenced as necessary. The FOP
       Project will attempt to use the latest version of evolving specifications.
