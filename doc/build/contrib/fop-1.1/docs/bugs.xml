      <p>
        User reports of bugs and requests for enhancements are extremely
        important parts of FOP development, and we appreciate the time you take to help
        us track these issues down.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To help us ensure that the bug database is as useful as it should be, please
          use the <link href="gethelp.html">Getting Help</link> checklist to determine whether a bug report should be entered.
        </li>
        <li>
          Review the <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html">Apache Bug
          Writing Guidelines</link> before submitting your report.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enter a new issue report at <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fop">The
          FOP issue database (Bugzilla)</link>. You will be asked to login to an existing Bugzilla account or to
          create a new one. When entering the bug report, please make your description complete and concise.
          If the issue involves a specific input or output file, then you <strong>MUST</strong> include the
          following information in the bug report (preferably as one or more attachments):
          <ul>
            <li>
              an input XSL-FO file (an input XML plus XSLT file is not acceptable, unless and only if the
              issue being reported is related to the built-in XSLT transform processing convenience function provided
              by FOP); this input <strong>SHOULD</strong> be <em>maximally minimal</em>, which means that it should
              contain nothing more than the minimum needed to demonstrate the problem; if you do not take the effort
              to provide a maximally minimal input FO file, then you will be subsequently asked to do so before the
              bug is processed;
            </li>
            <li>
              a resulting output file, preferably in PDF format; if the issue being reported involves a different output
              format, then provide both a PDF output file and the output file for the output format for which the report
              applies;
            </li>
            <li>
              a copy of the FOP configuration file you used (e.g., fop.xconf);
            </li>
            <li>
              if FOP was invoked using the command line (or an equivalent), then a dump of both the input
              command line and any console output (stderr or stdout) produced; if the report involves an
              exception, then this <strong>MUST</strong> include the full stack back trace;
            </li>
            <li>
              information describing the version of FOP you are using and the platform (and OS) on which
              you are invoking FOP;
            </li>
            <li>
              if the report applies to the use of a specific font other than one of the built-in, base 14
              fonts, then information that describes where to obtain the font.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          After submission, a copy of your bug report will be automatically
          sent to the FOP developer discussion list. If additional information is needed to
          process the bug, then the bug will be set to the <code>NEEDSINFO</code> state, and
          you will be asked to provide the additional information. You can avoid this extra
          step by being diligent about providing <strong>all</strong> of the information
          indicated above.
