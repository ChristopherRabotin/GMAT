    <title>Configuration File Basics</title>
    <p>
      The Apache&#8482; FOP configuration file is an XML file containing a variety of settings that are useful
      for controlling FOP's behavior, and for helping it find resources that you wish it to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The easiest way to get started using a FOP configuration file is to copy the sample found 
      at <code>{fop-dir}/conf/fop.xconf</code> to a location of your choice, and then to 
      edit it according to your needs.
      It contains templates for the various configuration options, most of which are commented 
      out. Remove the comments and change the settings for entries that you wish to use.
      Be sure to follow any instructions, including comments which specify the value range.
      Also, since the configuration file is XML, be sure to keep it well-formed.
    </p>
    <section id="general-available">
      <title>Making Configuration Available to FOP</title>
      <p>After creating your configuration file, you must tell FOP how to find it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If running FOP from the command-line, see the "-c" command-line option in 
          <link href="running.html">Running FOP</link>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If running FOP as an embedded application, see 
          <link href="embedding.html#config-external">Embedding, Using a Configuration File</link>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        See <link href="embedding.html#config-internal">Setting the Configuration Programmatically</link>
        for instructions on how to do so in an embedded environment.

  <section id="image-loading">
    <title>Image Loading Customization</title>
    <p>
      Apache FOP uses the image loading framework from
      <link href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/commons/">Apache XML Graphics Commons</link> to load
      images using various plug-ins. Every image loader plug-in has a hard-coded usage penalty
      that influences which solution is chosen if there are multiple possibilities to load an image.
      Sometimes, though, these penalties need to be tweaked and this can be done in the FOP
      configuration. An example:
    </p>
    <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<fop version="1.0">
  [..]
  <image-loading>
    <penalty value="10000"
      class="org.apache.xmlgraphics.image.loader.impl.ImageLoaderRawCCITTFax"/>
    <penalty value="INFINITE"
      class="org.apache.xmlgraphics.image.loader.impl.ImageLoaderInternalTIFF"/>
  </image-loading>
  <renderers....
</fop>]]></source>
    <p>
      The first penalty element increases the penalty for the raw CCITT loader. This practically
      forces the decoding of CCITT compressed TIFF images except if there are no TIFF codecs
      available. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The second penalty element sets an "infinite" penalty for the TIFF loader using the internal
      TIFF codec. This practically disables that plug-in as it will never be chosen as a possible
      solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Negative penalties are possible to promote a plug-in but a negative penalty sum will be
      treated as zero penalty in most cases. For more details on the image loading framework,
      please consult the documentation there.
    </p>

  <section id="renderers">
    <title>Renderer configuration</title>
    <p>
      Each Renderer has its own configuration section which is identified by the
      MIME type the Renderer is written for, ex. "application/pdf" for the PDF Renderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The configuration for the PDF Renderer could look like this:
    </p>
    <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
  <renderers>
    <renderer mime="application/pdf">
      <filterList>
        <!-- provides compression using zlib flate (default is on) -->
        <value>flate</value>
      </filterList>
      <fonts>
        <font metrics-url="arial.xml" kerning="yes" embed-url="arial.ttf">
          <font-triplet name="Arial" style="normal" weight="normal"/>
          <font-triplet name="ArialMT" style="normal" weight="normal"/>
        </font>
        <font metrics-url="arialb.xml" kerning="yes" embed-url="arialb.ttf">
          <font-triplet name="Arial" style="normal" weight="bold"/>
          <font-triplet name="ArialMT" style="normal" weight="bold"/>
        </font>
      </fonts>
    </renderer>
    
    <renderer mime="application/postscript">
    <!-- etc. etc..... -->]]></source>
    <p>
      The details on the font configuration can be found on the separate <link href="fonts.html">Fonts</link> page.
      Note especially the section entitled <link href="fonts.html#register">Register Fonts with FOP</link>.
    </p>
    <section id="pdf-renderer">
      <title>Special Settings for the PDF Renderer</title>
      <p>
        The configuration element for the PDF renderer contains two elements. One is for the font configuration
        (please follow the link above) and one is for the "filter list". The filter list controls how the
        individual objects in a PDF file are encoded. By default, all objects get "flate" encoded (i.e. simply 
        compressed with the same algorithm that is also used in ZIP files). Most users don't need to change that
        setting. For debugging purposes, it may be desired not to compress the internal objects at all so the
        generated PDF commands can be read. In that case, you can simply use the following filter list. The 
        second filter list (type="image") ensures that all images still get compressed but also ASCII-85 encoded
        so the produced PDF file is still easily readable in a text editor.
      </p>
    <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    <renderer mime="application/pdf">
      <filterList>
        <value>null</value>
      </filterList>
      <filterList type="image">
        <value>flate</value>
        <value>ascii-85</value>
      </filterList>
      
      <fonts....
    </renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        Another (optional) setting specific to the PDF Renderer is an output color profile, an ICC 
        color profile which indicates the target color space the PDF file is generated for. This 
        setting is mainly used in conjunction with the <link href="pdfx.html">PDF/X</link> feature. 
        An example:
      </p>
    <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    <renderer mime="application/pdf">
      <filterList...
      
      <output-profile>C:\FOP\Color\EuropeISOCoatedFOGRA27.icc</output-profile>
      
      <fonts....
      </renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        Some people don't have high requirements on color fidelity but instead want the smallest
        PDF file sizes possible. In this case it's possible to disable the default sRGB color space
        which XSL-FO requires. This will cause RGB colors to be generated as device-specific RGB.
        Please note that this option is unavailable (and will cause an error) if you enable
        PDF/A or PDF/X functionality or if you specify an output profile. This setting will make the
        PDF about 4KB smaller. To disable the sRGB color space add the following setting:
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    <renderer mime="application/pdf">
      <filterList...
      
      <disable-srgb-colorspace>true</disable-srgb-colorspace>
      
      <fonts....
      </renderer>]]></source>
      
      <p>FOP supports encryption of PDF output, thanks to Patrick C. Lankswert.
      This feature is commonly used to prevent unauthorized viewing, printing, editing, copying text
      from the document and doing annotations. It is also possible to ask the user for a password in
      order to view the contents. Note that there already exist third party applications which can
      decrypt an encrypted PDF without effort and allow the aforementioned operations, therefore the
      degree of protection is limited.  For further information about features and restrictions
      regarding PDF encryption, look at the documentation coming with Adobe Acrobat or the technical
      documentation on the Adobe web site.</p>

     <p>
       By default FOP produces PDF files of version 1.4, but this can be changed in order to benefit 
       from features that appeared in newer versions of PDF. At the moment, only a few features from 
       PDF 1.5 have been implemented, but the configuration element will accept any value between 
       1.4 and 1.7. This is the value that will appear in the PDF header, although only features up 
       to 1.5 will actually be used.
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[

      <title>Special Settings for the PostScript Renderer</title>
      <p>
        Besides the normal font configuration (the same "fonts" element as for the PDF renderer) the PostScript
        renderer has an additional setting to force landscape pages to be rotated to fit on a page inserted into
        the printer in portrait mode. Set the value to "true" to activate this feature. The default is "false".
        Example:

    <section id="pcl-renderer">
      <title>Special Settings for the PCL Renderer</title>
      <p>
        Non-standard fonts for the PCL renderer are made available through the Java2D subsystem which means that
        you don't have to do any custom font configuration in this case but you have to use the font names
        offered by Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, there are certain settings that control how the renderer handles various elements.
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<renderer mime="application/x-pcl">
  <rendering>quality</rendering>
  <text-rendering>bitmap</text-rendering>
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        The default value for the "rendering" setting is "speed" which causes borders 
        to be painted as plain rectangles. In this mode, no special borders (dotted, 
        dashed etc.) are available. If you want support for all border modes, set the
        value to "quality" as indicated above. This will cause the borders to be painted
        as bitmaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "text-rendering" setting is "auto" which paints the
        base fonts using PCL fonts. Non-base fonts are painted as bitmaps through Java2D.
        If the mix of painting methods results in unwelcome output, you can set this
        to "bitmap" which causes all text to be rendered as bitmaps.

      <title>Special Settings for the AFP Renderer</title>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, there are certain settings that control how the renderer handles various elements.
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<renderer mime="application/x-afp">
  <images mode="b+w" bits-per-pixel="8" native="true"/>
  <renderer-resolution>240</renderer-resolution>
  <line-width-correction>2.5</line-width-correction>
  
  <!-- a default external resource group file -->
  <resource-group-file>resources.afp</resource-group-file>
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        The default value for the images "mode" setting is "b+w" (black and white).  When the images "mode" setting is "b+w" a "bits-per-pixel" setting can be provided to aid the grayscale conversion process.  With this setting all images referenced in your source document are converted to an IOCA FS45 grayscale bitmap image form. 
        When the setting is "color" all images are converted to an IOCA FS45 color bitmap image form.  When "native" setting is "true", all images encountered (TIFF, GIF, JPEG and Encapsulated Postscript etc.) will be embedded directly in the datastream in their native form using a MO:DCA Object Container.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "renderer-resolution" is 240 dpi. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The default line width is device dependent and may need to be fine tuned so that the output matches the expected result. The default correction value is 2.5.
      </p>
 <!--
      <p>
        The default value for the MO:DCA "interchange-set" is "MO:DCA-L". Other compliance settings include presentation interchange sets "MO:DCA-P IS/1" and "MO:DCA-P IS/2" (Resource Groups). 
      </p>
 -->
      <p>
        By default if there is no configuration definition for "resource-group-file", external resources will be placed in a file called resources.afp.

          <title>When it does not work</title>

          <p>FOP searches the configuration file for the information it
expects, at the position it expects. When that information is not
present, FOP will not complain, it will just continue. When there is
other information in the file, FOP will not complain, it will just
ignore it. That means that when your configuration information is in
the file but in a different XML element, or in a different XML path,
than FOP expects, it will be silently ignored.</p>

          <p>Check the following possibilities:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The format of the configuration file has changed
considerably between FOP 0.20.5 and FOP 1.0 and its beta versions. Did
you convert your file to the new format?</li>

            <li>The FOP distribution contains a schema for configuration
files, at src/foschema/fop-configuration.xsd. Did you validate your
configuration file against it? Add the following schema location to
the <code>schema</code> element:

<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<fop
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=
"http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/xmlgraphics/fop/trunk/src/foschema/fop-configuration.xsd?view=co">
]]></source>

and run the configuration file through a validating schema
parser. Note that the schema cannot detect all errors, and that it is
stricter about the order of some elements than FOP itself is.</li>

            <li>Run FOP in debug mode (command line option
<code>-d</code>). This makes FOP report which configuration
information it finds. Check if FOP finds what you expect.</li>

          </ul>
