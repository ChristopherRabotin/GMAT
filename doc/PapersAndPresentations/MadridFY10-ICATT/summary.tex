\section{Summary}

This paper provided an overview of the General Mission Analysis Tool, GMAT, and
then provided some detail about how GMAT can be tailored through plug-in
components loaded at run time.  The discussion of the plug-in capabilities
described the elements that GMAT expects for a plug-in module: the new
functionality itself, the supporting factory or factories that make the module
visible in GMAT's engine, and the interface code used to load the plug-in
features.  An example, implemented in code available for free download, was
described that illustrated the addition of a force for GMAT's force model. 
Finally, the steps needed to tell GMAT about the new functionality were
provided.

Groups or individuals interested in GMAT can obtain a copy of the system from
the GMAT website at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,
http://gmat.gsfc.nasa.gov.  The code for GMAT can be downloaded from
SourceForge using the project address: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmat. 
The GMAT plug-in example described in this paper can be downloaded from the
GMAT plug-in project at SourceForge,
https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmatplugins.  Finally, GMAT's developer and
user communities can be found at our forum and wiki sites,
http://gmat.ed-pages.com/forum/index.php and
